The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread fraud.
The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government alone.
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.
The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.
The two parties said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.
Hun Sen, however, rejected that.
