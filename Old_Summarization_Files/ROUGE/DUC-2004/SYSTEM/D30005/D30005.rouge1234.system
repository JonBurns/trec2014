Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is thought to be living in Afghanistan.
He has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
The report was typed on a computer seized last year by Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week in U.S. district court in Manhattan.
It is not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to bin Laden.
