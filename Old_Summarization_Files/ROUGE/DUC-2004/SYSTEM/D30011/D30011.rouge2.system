On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
A number of Anwar's associates are still detained.

He told the magistrate's courts he was beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest.
Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, as his successor.

In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog.
As of Tuesday, 12 had been released.
Anwar said Mahathir viewed him as a threat.
