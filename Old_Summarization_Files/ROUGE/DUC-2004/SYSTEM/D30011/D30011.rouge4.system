Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.
Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations.
Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises on his neck and arms.
In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog.
