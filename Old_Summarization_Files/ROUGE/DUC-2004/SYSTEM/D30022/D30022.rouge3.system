Xu spent 12 years in prison.
Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17.
The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody.
One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of subversive activities.
Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
That is cited as grounds for the subversion charge, the information center said.
Don't take this case.
