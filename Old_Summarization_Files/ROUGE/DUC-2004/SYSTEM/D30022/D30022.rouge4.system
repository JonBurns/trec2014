The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many more are missing and believed to be in custody.
Last week the Chinese government arrested 10 members and sympathizers of the China Democracy Party, one of whom, Wang Youcai, is to go on trial Dec. 17.
One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and the other, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion of subversive activities.
Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of it in solitary confinement.
That is cited as grounds for the subversion charge, the information center said.
Wang was a student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations.
