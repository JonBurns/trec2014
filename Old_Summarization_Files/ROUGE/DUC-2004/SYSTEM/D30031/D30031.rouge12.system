That did the trick.
It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up their hands.
The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay.
The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made component, will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer.
