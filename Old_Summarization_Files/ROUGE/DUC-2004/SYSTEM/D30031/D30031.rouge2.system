The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up their hands.
Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the cargo bay.
The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
The night sky was clear, and the moon full.
