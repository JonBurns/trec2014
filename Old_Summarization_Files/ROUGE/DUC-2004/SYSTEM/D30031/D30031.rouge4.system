The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight.
The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
