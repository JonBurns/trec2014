Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.
