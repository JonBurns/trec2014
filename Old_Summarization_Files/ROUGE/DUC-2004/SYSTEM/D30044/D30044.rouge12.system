To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's most-wanted criminal.
He is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist.
Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition.
The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last week in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers Party PKK, Zehetmayr said.
This may be the PKK's best option.
Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike.
He leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow to pressure.
