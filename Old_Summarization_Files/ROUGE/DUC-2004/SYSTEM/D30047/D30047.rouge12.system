Newman had a 10-foot grappling hook for the job.
It is due to be completed by 2004.
It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications.
The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion.
Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks.
