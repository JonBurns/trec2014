Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement.
The dead youth, Nasr Erekat, was a cousin of his.
Everyone has a stake in it.
