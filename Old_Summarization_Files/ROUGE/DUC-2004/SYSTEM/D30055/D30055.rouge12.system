The vote, 3rd graf prv
Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
In the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a member of the coalition.
If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation.
He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.
As it is, Prodi has outlasted all but Bettino Craxi, who served 3 years in two back-to-back stints from 1983 to 1987.
