Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house.
By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.
In the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a member of the coalition.
Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support.
