By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.
Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house.
Prodi's government has held together this long in large part because of the widely shared desire to see Italy qualify for the 1999 debut of Europe's common currency, the euro.
