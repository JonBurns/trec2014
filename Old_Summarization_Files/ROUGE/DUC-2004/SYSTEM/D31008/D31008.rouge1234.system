Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword.
Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious.
Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
And a war it is.
