Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
In Casper, a conservative city of 51,000, located in the heart of Wyoming's oil belt, tolerance has become the watchword.
Others traveled here, one driving from as far away as New Jersey, out of a sense of solidarity.
The two men charged in the killing of Shephard are both white, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22.
And a war it is.
