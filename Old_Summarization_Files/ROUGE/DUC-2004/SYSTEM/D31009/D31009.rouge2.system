Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
Ecevit, who was prime minister three times since 1974, has over the years shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s.
The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament.
Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
At the same time, however, he has shown himself to be a fierce nationalist.
