The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
The dance was on the second floor.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend.
On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said.
