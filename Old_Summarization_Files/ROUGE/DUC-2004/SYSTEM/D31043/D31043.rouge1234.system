Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
Hariri, 53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.
But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime minister.
All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.
