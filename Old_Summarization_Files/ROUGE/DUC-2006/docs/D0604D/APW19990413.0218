NEW YORK ( AP ) -- With `` Star Wars '' mania heating up across the nation , retailers are gearing up for what 's expected to be one of the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history . 
Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its 1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3 , the first day that merchants are permitted to sell goods based on `` Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace . '' 
The Paramus , N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large area of its stores entirely to the `` Star Wars '' line . 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the nation 's biggest retailer , told The Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of `` Star Wars '' items beginning on May 3 . 
`` Star Wars '' -related goods -- from snack foods to body lotion to skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments in Wal-Mart 's stores . 
`` Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related merchandise than any other film in our history , '' said Les Copeland , spokesman for Bentonville , Ark.-based Wal-Mart . 
Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $ 2 billion this year alone , with an estimated $ 1 billion coming from toy sales . 
The movie debuts May 19. 
Merchants expect anxious `` Star Wars '' fans -- both children and avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on May 3 , hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie merchandise . 
`` Star Wars '' director George Lucas signed strict licensing deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing virtually all information on their products to the general public , including the media . 
Lucas , who financed the $ 115 million movie himself , also chose the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves . 
Given the huge demand for this merchandise , merchants will keep the `` Star Wars '' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin stocking store shelves late on May 2 .
