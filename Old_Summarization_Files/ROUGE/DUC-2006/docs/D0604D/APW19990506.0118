LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Now that a few people have actually seen the new `` Star Wars '' movie in special screenings , the hype has yielded to the buzz . 
And the buzz is ... well , do n't expect a masterpiece , just a really good movie with cool special effects . 
In other words , a certain summer blockbuster . 
`` Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace '' was screened Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater executives , their families , and -- apparently -- a bundle of `` Star Wars '' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets . 
Almost immediately , early reviews hit cyberspace , followed by the reactions to the reviews , then the reactions to the reactions , along with all manner of claims , counterclaims , insults and soul-searching over the film , which opens nationwide May 19. 
`` Guys , it 's a movie ! '' responded Tom Sherak , distribution head of 20th Century Fox , which is releasing the film for George Lucas . 
`` It is n't the Bible ! 
It 's fun , it 's enjoyable , it 's escapism . 
But it 's a movie . '' 
Uh huh . 
In what was titled , `` What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet , '' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site 
( www.hometheaterforum.com ) 
that while he was impressed , the movie may not satisfy hard-core `` Star Wars '' fans . 
`` It looks like ' Star Wars , ' it smells like ' Star Wars ' and it feels like ' Star Wars . ' 
However , is it a ' Star Wars ' that we are going to walk away satisfied with ? 
Well ... perhaps , but not for everyone , '' Epstein wrote . 
While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects , including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence , some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places , that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters , Jar Jar Binks , was annoying . 
Such views , however , were quickly countered by those who , like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum , found the movie to be `` PHENOMENAL !!!!'' 
`` Do n't watch it to analyze and match other people 's reviews and thoughts to the film , just sit back , relax and enjoy the ride , '' he said . 
`` I did . '' 
On a leading `` Star Wars '' Web site , www.theforce.net , a writer using the nickname BetterJedi wrote , `` Wow ! 
What a film . 
I 'm going to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in . '' 
But another writer , going by Job21 , was n't as impressed . 
`` It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare , '' Job21 said . 
That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans , many of whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie , pointing out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would suggest he was there . 
As for the theater operators themselves , they gave their usual tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract higher fees for showing the film . 
The bottom line , financially , is the early buzz -- or for that matter the reactions from the professional critics who see `` Phantom '' Friday night -- wo n't mean a thing initially , said Paul Dergarabedian , of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. 
Inc. 
`` This movie is critic-proof , '' he said . 
`` I think it does n't matter what anybody says , good , bad or indifferent . 
The film is going to play big in those first two weeks without question . '' 
After that ... the Force only knows .
