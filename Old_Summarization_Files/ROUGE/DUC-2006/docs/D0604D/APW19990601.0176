LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- The `` Star Wars '' prequel is setting box-office records , but it is not alone . 
`` Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace '' was North America 's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend , bringing in $ 64.8 million for a total gross of $ 205 million in a record 13 days . 
`` Independence Day '' set the previous record in 21 days in 1996 . 
But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped `` Notting Hill '' pull in $ 27.8 million , the biggest opening ever for a romantic comedy . 
`` The Wedding Singer , '' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore , earned $ 21.9 million in three days last year . 
The comparable three-day figure for `` Notting Hill '' was $ 22.2 million . 
`` Star Wars '' locked up the children 's audience and the `` thrill ride '' fans , studio executives said , while the love story between Ms. Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place . 
Still , the `` Star Wars '' film is flying . 
It already holds records for opening day and five-day totals , and is the fastest to break the $ 100 million barrier ( five days ) . 
`` The movie 's like a thoroughbred . 
We put it on the track every day and it does n't disappoint you , '' said Tom Sherak , distribution head for 20th Century Fox . 
He said families are the key to the repeat business if `` Phantom '' is to thrive in the summer blockbuster season . 
Universal 's strategy to open its films before and after `` Star Wars '' paid off . 
`` The Mummy , '' the studio 's own thrill ride movie , was in third place last weekend with $ 12.7 million . 
It has grossed $ 117.1 million in four weeks . 
`` The marketplace has got to support more than one movie . 
There are different tastes , '' said Nikki Rocco , head of distribution for Universal . 
The only other new film in wide release , `` The Thirteenth Floor , '' opened in fifth place . 
The sci-fi film noir had a disappointing $ 4.3 million , industry estimates showed Monday . 
`` The Love Letter , '' also billed as a romantic alternative , tanked in its second week , dropping out of the top 10 list with a gross of $ 1.3 million . 
Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American theaters , according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
