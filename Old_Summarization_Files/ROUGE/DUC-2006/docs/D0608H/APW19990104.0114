DETROIT ( AP ) -- Ford Motor Co. will install a device that warns unbuckled drivers with an intermittent chime until they buckle their seat belts . 
The Belt-Minder system will be used throughout Ford 's U.S. product line starting later this year . 
President Jac Nasser announced the system Monday at the North American International Auto Show 's media preview . 
A sensor in the belt buckle determines if the driver has buckled up ; if not , a red light on the dashboard goes on and an intermittent chime sounds until the belt is latched . 
On most cars and trucks , a chime and light go on only when the ignition is turned on . 
`` We think it will improve safety belt usage tremendously , '' Nasser said . 
Drivers who do n't want to wear their belts can disable the intermittent chime by buckling , then unbuckling their belt . 
Nasser said seat belts are `` the most effective safety device there is , '' but that many who occasionally fail to buckle up say they simply forget or are too hurried . 
Ford said the system eventually will be expanded to include the front passenger seat . 
The No. 2 automaker said major insurance companies are considering discounts for those who own or lease vehicles equipped with the Belt-Minder .
