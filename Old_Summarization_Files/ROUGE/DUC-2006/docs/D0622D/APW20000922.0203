BALTIMORE ( AP ) - A dead crow found in a downtown neighborhood this week has tested positive for the West Nile virus , making it the third bird found in two weeks in Maryland with the mosquito-borne virus . 
The bird was found Sept. 18 in the Federal Hill section and tested in a state lab , Mike Morrill , a spokesman for Gov. Parris Glendening , said Friday night . 
The state Department of Agriculture planned to spray the pesticide Permethrin Saturday evening in a 2-mile area around where the bird was found , including in the Inner Harbor tourist area , Morrill said . 
The department is targeting populations of the Culex mosquito , which has tested positive for the virus in the past . 
State officials sprayed the same insecticide Friday at dusk in sections of Howard and Baltimore counties , where two birds with West Nile virus were found last week . 
No one in Maryland has been hospitalized with symptoms of the virus , which can be passed to humans through mosquito bites . 
West Nile virus can cause fatal encephalitis , usually among children , the elderly or people with weak immune systems . 
An environmental group expressed concern Friday about the anti-mosquito spraying , saying the risks of the pesticide outweigh the threat of West Nile to humans. '' The chance of humans becoming seriously ill from West Nile virus is very small , '' the Maryland Pesticide Network said . 
The group said pesticides such as Permethrin have been linked to brain cancer in children . 
It said several Connecticut communities have opted not to spray for mosquitoes because of such concerns . 
However , state officials said the pesticide is harmless and residents do not have to stay indoor during the spraying . 
Those who still have concerns are advised to leave the spray area or remain inside , Morrill said . 
Sixty-two people have been tested for the West Nile virus this year , health officials said . 
Of those , one was suffering from encephalitis ; 32 had aseptic , or viral , meningitis ; and others suffered from a variety of diseases or conditions , said John Sweitzer , an epidemiologist with the state health department . 
None tested positive for West Nile virus. '' We 've been trying to encourage physicians to submit samples for testing , '' Sweitzer said. '' And with this publicity , we think we 're going to get a lot more samples rolling in . '' 
Residents finding dead or dying birds are asked to call the Department of Natural Resources ' toll-free hotline at 1-888-584-3110 .
