BOSTON _ A dead crow that had been infected with West Nile virus was found in the city , health authorities said Wednesday , confirming that the exotic encephalitis virus has migrated here and prompting officals to calmly warn the public to protect themselves against mosquitoes . 
The West Nile virus is spread by mosquito bites and scientists said Wednesday they are unsure how widespread it is among Boston 's mosquito population . 
Birds can not spread it to humans . 
After discovering the infected crow Saturday , public health officials began testing mosquitoes to see if any were carrying the virus . 
Those results are due Thursday and will determine if mosquito spraying outside the immediate Willow Pond area of Jamaica Plain , where the dead crow was discovered , is necessary . 
They will also consider aerial spraying , though only if signs emerge that large numbers of mosquitoes here carry the virus . 
In the meantime , officals said residents will be notified if areas around their homes are to be targeted . 
They advised people to wear long clothing when outdoors and to use insect repellent liberally . 
There have not been a human cases of West Nile reported in the state . 
Last year the virus sickened 55 people and killed 7 in Queens , N.Y. , all of them elderly . 
On Monday , New York officals closed that city 's massive Central Park after infected mosquitoes were found there , though no humans have tested positive . 
Believed to have originated in Africa and Asia , West Nile is most likely to be fatal in the elderly , and state officials said all cautions apply doubly to them . 
Infants are also at higher risk . 
In most younger , healthy people the virus is typically benign . 
State officals said they will aggressively test all dead animals found in the area for signs of the virus . 
Hospitals will also be on the lookout for patients with West Nile-like symptoms . 
Horses throughout the state will be tested . 
Residents were urged to protect themselves and pets against mosquitoes , and empty any outdoor containers filled with water because mosquitoes breed around stagnant water . 
`` We have no idea how intense the force of transmission is locally . 
It may be that we will see another Queens 1999 in Boston or that ( Wednesday 's findings ) are the end of things , '' said Andrew Spielman , a professor of tropical public health at Harvard School of Public Health . 
`` We 'll soon have some handle on how intense the outbreak is likely to be , or if there will be an outbreak . '' 
State officals have been testing dead crows regularly since the virus first appeared in New York last year . 
Though it was expected more likely to turn up in southern cities , where birds migrate , officials said they were n't caught off guard by Wednesday 's discovery . 
`` We 're not surprised at all at the findings , '' said Ralph Timpari , assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Laboratory Sciences . 
`` It 's a single bird . 
It 's not a time of being overly concerned . 
It 's an indication of how rare it is in Massachusetts . '' 
The West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain . 
It is transmitted through mosquitoes which become infected from birds that carry the virus . 
It can not be spread by person-to-person contact , such as touching , kissing or caring for someone who is infected . 
West Nile tends to produce flu-like symptoms , such as slight fevers , headaches and body aches , five to 15 days after the initial bite . 
The most severe infections can cause headache , high fever , neck stiffness , stupor , disorientation , coma , tremors , convulsions , paralysis and sometimes death . 
In most of the people who get the virus , it passes unnoticed . 
Only a small percentage require hospitalization . 
Of those , only 7 percent die . 
There is no treatment and no vaccine . 
A WEST NILE VIRUS Q AND A Q. What is West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. West Nile encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by West Nile virus , which is commonly found in Africa , West Asia , and the Middle East . 
Q. How long has West Nile virus been in the U.S. ? 
A. 
It is not known how long it has been in the U.S. , but scientists believe the virus has probably been in the eastern U.S. since the early summer of 1999 , possibly longer . 
Q. How do people get West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. By the bite of a mosquito that is infected with West Nile virus . 
Q. What is the basic transmission cycle ? 
A. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds . 
After an incubation period of 10 days to 2 weeks , infected mosquitoes can then transmit West Nile virus to humans and animals . 
Q. Can you get West Nile encephalitis from another person ? 
A. No. 
West Nile encephalitis is NOT transmitted from person-to-person . 
Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from birds ? 
A. There is no evidence that a person can get the virus from handling live or dead infected birds . 
Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from other insects or ticks ? 
A. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for West Nile virus . 
Ticks infected with West Nile virus have been found in Asia and Africa . 
Q. What are the symptoms of West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. Most infections are mild and symptoms include fever , headache , and body aches , often with skin rash and swollen lymph glands . 
More severe infection may be marked by headache , high fever , neck stiffness , stupor , disorientation , coma , tremors , convulsions , muscle weakness , paralysis and , rarely , death . 
Q. How is West Nile encephalitis treated ? 
A. There is no specific therapy . 
In more severe cases , intensive supportive therapy is indicated , i.e. , hospitalization , intravenous fluids , airway management , respiratory support and good nursing care . 
Q. Is there a vaccine against West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. No. 
Q. What is the incubation period in humans ( time from infection to onset of disease symptoms ) for West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. Usually 3 to 15 days . 
Q. Who is at risk for getting West Nile encephalitis ? 
A. All residents of areas where virus activity has been identified ; persons greater than 50 years of age have the highest risk of severe disease . 
Q. What proportion of people die when infected with West Nile virus ? 
A. Case-fatality rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent and are highest in the elderly . 
Q. How many cases of West Nile encephalitis occurred in the U.S. in 1999 ? 
A. Before August 1999 , West Nile virus had never been reported in the U.S. In 1999 , 62 cases of severe disease , including 7 deaths , occurred in the New York area . 
No reliable estimates are available for the number of cases of West Nile encephalitis that occur worldwide . 
Q. Can infected dogs or cats be carriers and transmit West Nile virus to humans ? 
A. There is no documented evidence of person-to-person , animal-to-animal , or animal-to-person transmission of West Nile virus . 
Q. What can I do to reduce my risk of becoming infected with West Nile virus ? 
A. Stay indoors at dawn , dusk , and in the earlyevening . 
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are outdoors . 
Apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin . 
An effective repellent will contain 35 percent DEET ( N , N-diethyl-meta-toluamide ) . DEET in high concentrations ( greater than 35 percent ) provides no additional protection .
