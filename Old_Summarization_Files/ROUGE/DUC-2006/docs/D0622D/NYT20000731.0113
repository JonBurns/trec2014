The crow was just lying there . 
Its eyes were open . 
It was breathing . 
But there was no movement in its greasy black wings . 
Park ranger Jennifer Grant walked up to it cautiously . 
She stamped her foot . 
The crow struggled to its feet , unfurling its wings to fly . 
Instead , it keeled over , falling back into the dirt next to Willow Pond in Boston 's Jamaica Plain section , its wings quivering . 
Grant put on plastic gloves and scooped the ailing bird into a cardboard box . 
`` Ever since last summer , we were told to keep an eye out for that sort of thing , '' she said . 
Last summer an outbreak of the West Nile virus killed seven people in Queens , N.Y. , and sickened more than 60 others . 
Hundreds of crows died as well . 
Every park ranger and public health specialist on the East Coast has been on alert since . 
On July 22 , Grant trucked specimen No. 
ZL00036 to a laboratory , unaware she had stumbled onto the first sign the virus had come to Massachusetts . 
Another virus-positive crow found in Hopkinton , Mass. was later identified . 
But no people have been reported infected . 
The encephalitis virus usually produces flu-like symptoms but occasionally causes quick and fatal brain inflammation , especially in the elderly . 
It is spread to people by mosquitoes . 
The virus has turned up in mosquitoes in several New York counties and in Stamford , Conn. 
About 40 infected crows were found in the New York City region . 
Officials from Maine to Miami are frantically testing birds , mammals , and mosquitoes for signs of the virus . 
Boston health officials are certain that mosquitoes here are carriers . 
They just do n't know how many . 
But they do know this : the local population of the Culex pipiens mosquito , the primary carrier of West Nile virus , is in the midst of its annual explosion . 
It is also the time when people maximize their time outdoors . 
If there are human infections , they will probably turn up in the next few weeks . 
The Queens outbreak occurred in late August . 
But West Nile could also be a blip . 
Either way , scientists are watching . 
West Nile has been something of a wayward virus . 
It first appeared in Uganda , on the western bank of the Nile River , in 1937 and has since popped up here and there in Eastern Europe , Africa , and Asia . 
But 1999 was different . 
That year the virus sickened 1,000 and killed at least 40 on the Volga Delta in southern Russia , in a little-reported outbreak . 
It also killed an elderly couple and hundreds of geese in Israel . 
That puzzled scientists : The virus had never been so fatal to birds . 
Then it made its jump to the Western Hemisphere _ Queens . 
The genetic fingerprint of that strain was almost identical to the one in Israel . 
Researchers theorized how the virus might have made its move : an infected Israeli airline passenger ? 
An infected bird blown across the Atlantic ? 
They still do n't know . 
And they are unsure of the deadliness of the American strain . 
At an international meeting of infectious disease researchers in Atlanta two weeks ago , there seemed to be a consensus . 
`` Something has happened to this virus , '' said Sharone Green , an associate professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who attended . 
`` I think we 're seeing a new virus , but we 're not sure exactly how it has changed . '' 
Barbara Reynolds , a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's West Nile specialists , said : `` The fact is West Nile does kill . 
We 're looking and watching it closely to see if it 's more virulent than we see in other parts of the world . '' 
Amid the curiosity and excitement , scientists are realizing that the virus will probably be a feature of Eastern Seaboard summers for decades to come . 
`` We should get used to this , '' said Andrew Spielman , a professor of tropical public health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ------ Ralph Timperi was used to examining sick birds by last Monday when specimen No. 
ZL00036 landed in his lab in Boston . 
It was his 42d sick animal since June 1. 
His eight-person crew peeled back the dead crow 's scalp and extracted brain tissue . 
They treated the sample with different enzymes , chemicals , and dyes to read its genetic fingerprint . 
They had a CDC sample of West Nile virus to compare with it . 
The mixture formed a gel and an electric current was run through it . 
Then it was injected with an ethidium bromide stain . 
The team of researchers watched the stained crow brain sample form into white bands on the black sample of gel . 
When they saw the results , the researchers ran downstairs to their boss 's office . 
`` I ran up to the lab to take a look at the photo they 'd taken of the sample , '' said Timperi . 
He saw the tell-tale white stripes on the gel dish and turned to his staff : `` Let 's get moving . '' 
There were more tests to be done to confirm West Nile but Timperi was sure _ even though the CDC would soon dispute him _ that he had found the virus . 
He started a chain of phone calls on Tuesday that ended at the residence of Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino . 
But the series of events that brought the virus here is far murkier . 
Scientists agree that the Queens outbreak was the virus 's entry into the United States but are unsure how it got from Queens to Boston and from the Eastern to the Western Hemisphere . 
The West Nile virus found in Queens is genetically very similar to the strain that turned up in Israel . 
There it killed an elderly couple from Moscow who had immigrated to Tel Aviv . 
Also , a 34-year-old woman from England was sickened , but not fatally , in the southern part of the country . 
The Israelis had not even noticed the outbreak until the publicity around the Queens case spread . 
In fact , the virus has surfaced several times in Israel since 1957 . 
This will be the case in the United States for years to come , scientists suggest . 
Scientists have four theories on how the virus traveled . 
The theories illustrate the ways a virus can nation-hop . 
The first , and most likely , said scientists , is that the virus boarded a commercial airline flight to the United States . 
`` An infected mosquito bit a guy in the Middle East , he hops on a plane and lands in New York , where he is bitten by another mosquito . 
That mosquito spreads it , '' said Spielman of Harvard . 
`` And the guy may have never known he was sick . '' 
Heavy air traffic has allowed viruses to spread much more quickly , said scientists . 
They can now go to any country where they can find warm temperatures and hosts to infect . 
`` Air travel has decreased the size of the world effectively , '' said Richard Pollack , a public health entomologist at Harvard . 
The second theory is that an infected bird from western Africa was blown here . 
Most birds could not make the flight on their own , but a cyclone or heavy winds could have dropped them here . 
In 1998 , researchers found that several million locusts had been blown from West Africa to the Caribbean . 
Thirdly , scientists theorize that an infected bird was brought , perhaps illegally , to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York . 
According to the US Customs Service , 2,770 birds entered the United States that way in 1999 . 
The final theory returns to mosquitoes : a bunch of infected insects somehow got transported here via airplane . 
This , too , is possible . 
Researchers recently transported live mosquitoes across the Atlantic Ocean by placing them in the wheel carriage of a 747 jet . 
Most scientists agree the West Nile virus 's journey from New York to Boston occurred in birds . 
Infected mosquitoes bite New York birds , then the birds migrate to different parts of the East Coast , where more mosquitoes bite them and spread the virus . 
Corvus brachyrhynchos , or American crow , has a migratory pattern that takes it from New England , New York , and Canada in the summer to Texas , Arkansas , Louisiana , and Florida in the winter , according to a recent study by researchers at the National Zoo in Washington . 
Almost all of the New England routes pass near New York City . 
Public health officials were expecting West Nile to show up in a city south of New York because birds are headed that way in late summer . 
Last year one dead crow infected with the virus turned up in Baltimore . 
But crows roam widely , and it is possible that an infected crow simply flew here this summer from New York City. ----- On Wednesday , Dr. Anita Barry , director of the Boston Health Commission 's communicable disease program , convened a meeting of local officials at Timperi 's lab . 
The CDC was disputing Timperi 's West Nile diagnosis but it was decided the public should be warned anyway . 
`` I think the most important thing we wanted to do is get accurate information out to people that the risk of getting the virus is quite low and that you can make it even lower by taking some precautions , '' said Barry . 
They went before TV cameras at 3 p.m. and announced the discovery of the infected crow . 
The mayor repeated the announcement several hours later . 
And in what became almost an afterthought , hours after Menino 's speech , the CDC called to tell Timperi he was right . 
The drill was handy in one sense : Officials say they will probably have to do it many times again . 
`` West Nile is living here now , '' said Green of the UMass Medical School . 
`` And there 's no way we can get rid of it . ''
