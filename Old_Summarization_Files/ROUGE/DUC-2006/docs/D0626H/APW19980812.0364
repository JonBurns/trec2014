CANBERRA , Australia ( AP ) _ 
An Australian man who was among 14 foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania has been released , Australian officials said Wednesday . 
Muhamed Hassan Qassim , a Somali-born Australian citizen , has been freed by Tanzanian authorities , said a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman , speaking on condition of anonymity . 
`` The department can confirm he has been released , '' the spokesman said . 
Qassim , believed to come from Sydney , had just arrived in Tanzania with his wife and five children to take up a position with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees when he was arrested by authorities investigating the blast . 
`` They 've been checking identities and papers and he was caught up in that , '' the spokesman said . 
UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg said Qassim was arrested for not carrying his passport in a security sweep following the blast . 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian man was not a suspect in the blast . 
`` To the best of my knowledge this Australian has been detained because he did n't have on his person a passport when he was stopped , '' Downer said . 
`` He does somewhere have an Australian passport but he did n't happen to have the passport on his person at the time he was questioned . 
`` I understand in Tanzania a lot of people have been stopped and asked questions by authorities , but there is n't any indication that he had in any way any involvement whatsoever in the bombings that took place . '' 
The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70 , while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at least 224 people and injured 5,000 . 
The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing include six Iraqis , six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen .
