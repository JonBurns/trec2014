PITTSBURGH ( AP ) -- A new computer virus can allow documents to be e-mailed to other people without warning , a potential security breach that should worry businesses and governments , an expert at Carnegie Mellon University said Saturday . 
The `` Melissa macro '' or W97M -- Melissa virus spreads via infected e-mail and attacks computers loaded with Microsoft 's widely used Word 97 or Word 2000 programs , according to CERT -- or Computer Emergency Response Team -- Carnegie Mellon 's Department of Defense-funded computer security team . 
CERT first heard of the virus Friday afternoon and its members worked through the night to analyze the virus and develop a fix , CERT manager Katherine Fithen said . 
`` We 're getting so many reports from across the world , that we know this is going to be a huge problem come Monday , '' Fithen said . 
She noted that since CERT was founded 10 years ago , this is only the second time it has considered a virus important enough to warrant a public announcement . 
The first , in 1994 , warned of a virus that allowed computer burglars to collect passwords . 
CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated . 
Fithen said she is not allowed to say whether any governmental agency has suffered a security breach as the result of Melissa . 
Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said company programmers worked with CERT and manufacturers of anti-virus programs to develop an antidote . 
If a computer user opens an infected Word-format document , the virus propagates itself by reading the user 's e-mail address book and sending an infected message to the first 50 entries , CERT said . 
The message can include the contents of any Word document that is open on the computer , Fithen said . 
Also , the virus reproduces and sends so much unwanted e-mail that the volume can overload some mail servers , the computers that distribute e-mail . 
However , it apparently causes no direct damage to a computer 's memory or programs . 
Infected documents are sent as attachments to e-mails most frequently bearing a header : `` Subject : Important Message From '' the name of person whose computer relayed the virus . 
The body of the message says `` Here is that document you asked for ... do n't show it to anyone else ; - ) . '' * ------ EDITOR 'S NOTE : CERT information about the Melissa virus is available on the Web at http : //www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-04-Melissa-Macro-Virus.html .
