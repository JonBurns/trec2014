When last we talked , my computer was beset by the Happy99 virus/worm , which was being passed back and forth on one of my mailing lists like a cold in a grade school class . 
If you just tuned in , and do n't spend much time on the Internet , Happy99 is a relatively benign virus in that it does n't destroy anything . 
It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins every message you send as an attachment . 
You , however , are unware of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail recipients . 
Like any virus , it is an executable program , and is n't supposed to work at all unless you execute it . 
To the best of my knowledge , I never did that , but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand grenade ; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of e-mail , as soon as it was downloaded , it caused the computer to seize up . 
Nor could I erase it by any normal means ; only Norton AntiVirus was able to get rid of it . 
And I had to use a painfully slow Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out . 
Eventually , it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there . 
So , going into the Norton configuration program , I changed a couple of settings . 
Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus , it was ordered to delete the thing on sight . 
And instead of examining only .EXE files , it was told to examine everything . 
I 'm not sure which of these changes did the trick _ maybe both were required _ but upon downloading a group of messages which I knew contained the virus somewhere , everything went fine . 
No lockup . 
Upon examining the messages , the Happy99.exe attachment brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X. I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do something you think it ought to be able to do . 
It does n't always work , but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many user-changeable parameters , it 's always worth trying . 
Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer . 
It was n't presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had graphics . 
A quick check showed it was set to refuse graphics to speed up operations . 
This , however archaic , was apparently the default setting . 
If incidentally , you have executed the Happy99 virus , it 's not hard to get rid of . 
There are lots of places on the Web with instructions , among them http : //www.geocities.com /SiliconValley/Heights/3652 /SKA.HTM . 
During all the unHappy furor , I installed the latest upgrade to Eudora Pro , the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm . 
I had been using Version 3.0 ; the latest is 4.1 . 
It 's a very worthwhile upgrade . 
The program has n't changed drastically , but lots of things work better . 
The main screen is divided into two windows now . 
The top window shows a list of your mail , and merely by bringing the cursor to any message , the text appears instantly in the lower window . 
No more tiresome double-clicking , and the presentation is much faster . 
Additionally , Eudora now makes the mail available in batches . 
If you have 200 messages waiting , it gives them to you 20 or so at a time so you do n't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download so you can begin reading . 
I have yet to see a mail program I like as well .
