MADRID , July 2 ( Xinhua ) -- Spanish computer experts have discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12 , the day of the World Cup finals in Paris . 
A spokesman for the Panda Software company said Thursday that the virus was " very complex and destructive " and could erase all data on the hard disk and automatically print unwanted documents to printers . 
The virus , which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents , will show a flashing banner of " Vive la coupe de monde ! " 
( Long live the World Cup ! ) on the screens of infected computers when a user tries to open an MS Word file . 
A dialogue window will then pop up and the user will be asked to choose which football team will win the game , while the virus will be working in the background . 
The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created in France as all of its files were written in French .
