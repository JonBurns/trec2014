In an escalating battle of the books , Amazon.com Inc. , the online retailer , cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent Monday , a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals , Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com , all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain rates . 
Amazon 's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No. 2 rival , BarnesNoble Inc. , which has imminent plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks . 
But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence . 
`` There are three things that drive this business , '' said Bill Curry , a spokesman for Amazon . 
`` It 's selection , price and convenience . 
And we are constantly working on all three of these things . 
We 've added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers . 
And this is an opportunity to do something with price . '' 
With a flurry of announcements on Monday , the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller lists . 
That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week . 
Generally , publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price , which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers . 
But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers , who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead . 
`` We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace , '' said Leonard Riggio , the chairman and chief executive of BarnesNoble , who added that Amazon has `` changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for itself . '' 
With a certain element of distaste , Borders.com , a unit of Borders Group Inc. , also announced a price-cut . 
`` I have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we 're going to win on in the long run , '' said Rich Fahle , a spokesman for Borders.com . 
`` But we 're not going to let this distinguish us from the competition . '' 
None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts . 
And , in fact , Amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts . 
( STORY CAN END HERE . 
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS ) Kate Delhagen , director of online retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc. , a technology research firm , said the outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new competitive pressures . 
There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers . 
For example , Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24 bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best price for the best-selling children 's novel , `` Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone . '' 
The list price is $ 16.95 , but with the discount and a shipping charge , Amazon was selling the title for $ 12.43 . 
`` People are using these comparison tools , '' Ms. Delhagen said . 
`` And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there . 
It 's definitely a defensive strategy being deployed , but it 's also part of their increasing energy to add customers to their database . '' 
Curry , Amazon 's spokesman , declined to say whether the company would lose money on the 50 percent discounts . 
`` We 're just not talking about whether we 're selling at a profit or a loss , '' he said . 
However , Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers . 
Those efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now passing along to its customers , he said . 
He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the activities of competitors . 
`` We do n't fancy ourselves with the competition , '' he said . 
`` We 're focused on our customers as opposed to what the competition is doing . ''
