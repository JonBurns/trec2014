AUSTIN , Texas _ 
The Texas prison system grew faster than any other in the country over the past decade , and one out of every 20 adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice system , according to national study released Monday . 
`` The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion , '' said Vincent Schiraldi , the director of the Justice Policy Institute of Washington , D.C. , and a co-author of the report , `` Texas Tough : An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the Lone Star State . '' 
According to the institute 's study , Texas also has the nation 's largest populations of probationers and parolees . 
The report confirms statistics that have long been known to state criminal justice policy analysts , and several proponents of tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the sentiments of most Texans . 
`` We did n't have this prison building boom by happenstance , '' said Dianne Clements , president of the crime-victims advocacy group , Justice for All . 
`` It happened because the citizens and taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no longer abide a revolving-door prison system . 
We realize there is a cost , and we are ready to foot the bill . '' 
That cost was high and will probably get higher . 
In the early 1990s , Texas voters authorized spending $ 1.7 billion in bonds to triple the size of the state 's prison system , which now exceeds 150,000 beds . 
When lawmakers return to Austin in January , they will be asked to send a $ 500 million bond package to the voters for the construction of three maximum-security units . 
In all , 163,190 state inmates are in custody in Texas , compared with 163,107 in California , according to the institute , which supports alternatives to prison . 
Tony Fabelo , who heads the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council , which assesses prison needs for state lawmakers , said the institute 's figures include inmates housed in low-risk substance-abuse treatment facilities and those in county jails awaiting transfer to state facilities . 
Other significant findings : _ The Texas prison population 's average annual increase of 11.8 percent during the 1990s was not only the highest growth in the nation , but was almost twice the average annual growth of the other states. _ If Texas were a country , it would have the highest incarceration rate in the world , easily surpassing that of the United States and Russia , the next two finishers , and would be seven times that of the next biggest prison system in China. _ 
Blacks in Texas are incarcerated at seven times the rate of whites , and nearly one in three young African-American men in Texas is under some form of criminal justice control . 
The institute is a think tank of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice , and the study was paid for with a grant from the Center on Crime , Communities and Culture . 
The groups provide programs for families of inmates and look for other solutions to criminal behavior beyond prisons , such as substance abuse treatment . 
The institute determined that Texas added 98,000 inmates to its prison system in the ' 90s , which is almost 25,000 more inmates than the population of New York 's entire system . 
Yet , since 1995 , New York 's decline in crime was four times greater than that of Texas , the study found . 
New York and Texas have almost the same population . 
According to the study , the crime rate declined much more slowly in Texas than it did in other large states . 
From 1993 to 1998 , crime in the Lone Star State fell 5.1 percent , half the national average , and the least of any of the nation 's five largest states . 
`` If locking more people up really reduced crime , Texas should have the lowest crime rate in the country , '' said Jason Ziedenberg , another co-author of the study . 
`` The cost of having one in three young black men under criminal justice control is a steep price to pay for the states ' lackluster crime declines . '' 
But a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush , the Republican presidential nominee , defended the state 's criminal justice policies as tough but fair . 
`` Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to let them know that there are consequences for their behavior , '' said Bush press aide Mike Jones . 
`` What the authors of that study might not understand is that Texas also has been very aggressive in using rehabilitation efforts and faith-based organizations to change people 's hearts . 
The bottom line to all these efforts is that , under Gov. Bush , Texas has the lowest violent crime rate in 26 years and the lowest murder rate since the 1950s . '' 
But state Sen. Rodney Ellis , D-Houston , said Texas should be receptive to critical assessments of its institutions and open to suggestions of policy changes . 
`` I think it is helpful that groups such as this force us to take a look at impact of our policies , '' Ellis said . 
`` I firmly believe in punishing those who break the law , but these are some pretty graphic statistics . 
`` We have to realize that our ` lock them up and throw away the key ' mentality is costing us a lot of money . 
Maybe there is too much emphasis on dealing with criminal justice issues on the back end of life rather than on the front end . '' _ ( Visit the Star-Telegram 's online services on the World Wide Web : www.star-telegram.com ) nn
