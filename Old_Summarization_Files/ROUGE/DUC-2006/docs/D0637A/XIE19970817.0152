NEW YORK , August 16 ( Xinhua ) -- The United States aims to increase the number of solar industry employees to 70,000 by 2010 from some 12,000 now , industry sources said . 
The goal is in line with the Clinton administration 's scheme to put a million solar systems on the roofs of commercial and residential buildings by 2010 . 
As the leading producer of solar energy in the world , the U.S. put out 38.9 megawatts in 1996 , sharing 44 percent of world production of 88.6 megawatts , followed by two other major producers -- Japan and Europe , the industry publication PV News reported . 
The government has invested some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the solar industry in the past 25 years and is continuing to encourage the use of solar cells to decrease gases omitted from burning of fossil fuels . 
Local governments have also started to make efforts in this direction . 
California is to allocate 54 million dollars in 1998 for subsidies to solar energy users while Arizona requires that at least 1 percent of new energy generation comes from solar resources . 
The industry has to lower solar cell prices to find more local consumers . 
About two thirds of last year 's solar cell sales totaling 850 million dollars came from overseas .
