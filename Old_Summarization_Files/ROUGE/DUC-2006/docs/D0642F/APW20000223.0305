CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP ) -- Venezuela is reconsidering its refusal to grant the United States use its airspace for anti-narcotics flights , Vice President Isaias Rodriguez said Wednesday . 
The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries : Venzuela says the flights infringe on its sovereignty , while U.S. officials say they 're needed to stem the flow of drugs from neighboring Colombia , the world 's top producer of cocaine . 
President Hugo Chavez 's critics say his stance jeopardizes good relations with the United States , which is Venezuela 's No. 1 trading partner . 
Chavez , who took office a year ago , has forged a close ties with Cuba and has spoken of the need to reduce U.S. influence in the world . 
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering asked Venezuela again last week to allow the anti-drug flights . 
`` We have fully agreed on the need to establish a policy of joint cooperation to confront the problem of Colombian drugs , '' Rodriguez said in an interview . 
He added that Venezuela was prepared to discuss the flights as long as they do not violate the country 's sovereignty . 
He did not elaborate . 
The United States wants to use Venezuela 's airspace for flights from three new staging centers it has set up in Ecuador and the islands of Curacao and Aruba , just off the Venezuelan coast . 
The centers were set up following the U.S. withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone , which had been used for the drug flights .
