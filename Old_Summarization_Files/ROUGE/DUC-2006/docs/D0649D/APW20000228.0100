MOSCOW ( AP ) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov on Monday agreed on at least one thing in their races for the presidency -- Russia has to eliminate its oligarchy . 
Corruption reaches into the highest levels of government in Russia , where a powerful , wealthy elite has formed while many ordinary people have sunk into deep poverty . 
`` It is crucial for us to create equal conditions for all , so that nobody can attach himself to the power and use these advantages for himself , '' Putin said in a meeting with workers in his campaign for the March 26 election . 
Zyuganov meanwhile told a news conference that he is fighting `` fat cats . '' 
Putin , employing some colloquially colorful phrasing , also said Russia needs `` not simply to knock off ( corrupt officials ) , but to know who must be knocked off and in what way , '' according to the ITAR-Tass news agency . 
Putin and his predecessors have talked tough about tackling corruption , but none have followed up with action against high-level functionaries suspected of bribe-taking , kickbacks and favoritism . 
Government policies are widely believed to be manipulated by a group of `` oligarchs '' -- powerful tycoons with close government connections -- who are widely despised in Russia . 
Putin has not yet released an election program , although he published an open letter to voters last week , promising to build a strong state , combat crime , protect private property , streamline the government and lower taxes . 
On Monday , Putin again said he would not nationalize private assets . 
`` The guarantees of property rights are not subject to any revision , '' he said . 
Meanwhile , Zyuganov -- who is trailing a distant second behind Putin in most opinion polls -- criticized Putin 's lack of a detailed platform . 
`` There are few specific proposals , mostly good intentions , '' Zyuganov said . 
His own platform remains little changed since his losing 1996 presidential bid , calling for partial nationalization of oil and natural resources companies to raise pensions . 
`` I 'm fighting the fat cats , the security regime and all the misinformation that comes whenever there is an election , '' he said . 
Uncertainty about Putin 's personal views and political program does not seem to have sapped his electoral chances . 
A poll released Monday by the independent Romir agency indicated that about nearly 60 percent of Russians were ready to vote for Putin , with 23 percent planning to back Zyuganov . 
The poll claimed a margin of error of about 4 percentage points .
