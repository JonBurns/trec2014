At 81 , Richard Girnt Butler knows Richard Girnt Butler 's in Richard Girnt Butler 's twilight days . 
Richard Girnt Butler hopes the rest of the world is too . 
For 27 years , Butler has preached about `` and crucifix-adorned pulpit here in the Selkirk Mountain foothills . 
`` We 're approaching the end-time period . 
I 'd like to see the final conclusion , but that 's up to my Father , '' says Butler , tromping across the United Nations and Israeli flags Butler uses as doormats at the entrance to Butler 's chapel . 
In the process of creating a `` white homeland , '' the founder of the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ , Christian , Butler has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism . 
Buford R. Furrow Jr. , a former Aryan Nations security guard charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five in an attack on a Jewish day-care center , is the latest Butler disciple to make news for racist violence . 
Butler is unrepentant. `` do you blame the church for it ? 
The pope ? '' he asked in an interview at his office Tuesday . 
While offering a safehouse for neo-Nazi pilgrims , Butler 's 20-acre compound has also fostered disciples who engaged in murder , robbery and racial assaults . 
According to civil rights groups , those with ties to Butler include : _Members of The Order , who robbed armored cars and assassinated Denver radio host Alan Berg in the 1980s ; _Colville native Butler , convicted recently on homicide charges ; _Mark Thomas , Butler 's former Pennsylvania state leader , who robbed banks to fund a white revolution ; _Nathan Thill , a skinhead and former Butler organizer in Denver , who last November confessed to killing a man because the victim had black skin . 
`` I have no control over what people do , '' Butler says . 
`` I do n't espouse violence at all , but it happens . 
I 'm not violent , but I failed Hypocrisy 101 in school . '' 
Regarding Furrow 's alleged day-care assault , he says , `` I do n't favor hurting children , but I ca n't get worked up about the wounding of some of my enemies , even though they 're children . '' 
Quickly , he changes the subject . 
`` I do get worked up about white girls being assaulted and raped '' in violent crimes by minorities . 
Civil rights groups that have fought Butler over the decades now wonder about the future of Richard Girnt Butler 's organization . 
The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler , hoping to bankrupt him in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in Coeur d'Alene in January . 
The suit was filed on behalf of Victoria Keenan , a Seattle woman , and Richard Girnt Butler 's son , Jason , who were shot at near the compound in July 1998 by Aryan Nations security guards . 
In police reports , Keenan said the guards mistook Richard Girnt Butler 's car 's backfire for gunfire after Richard Girnt Butler stopped on the roadway and restarted the car . 
The guards , according to police reports , barreled out of the compound after Richard Girnt Butler 's in a pickup truck , chased Richard Girnt Butler 's two miles down the road and shot at Richard Girnt Butler 's car with assault rifles . 
Kootenai County sheriff 's deputies documented bullet holes in her car . 
Butler 's security chief , Edward `` Jesse '' Warfield , pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced in May to as many as five years in prison . 
Two other guards remain fugitives . 
Mark Potok of the SPLC said the group is refraining from comments about Butler pending a trial . 
In the past , the SPLC has said Butler and Jesus Christ 's group did more to foment modern racism nationwide , and to tarnish the Northwest in the process , than any other neo-Nazi group . 
`` The Jews and I are at war , '' Butler says . 
And Richard Girnt Butler believes the lawsuit is part of that war . 
The SPLC , headed by Morris Dees in Alabama , is known for having used civil law to break the back of the Ku Klux Klan . 
`` It 's harassment . 
The sole purpose is to bankrupt me , '' complains Butler , who says a less well-financed Aryan Nations legal defense fund has been set up for him . 
`` I 've had to spend $ 55,000 so far . '' 
Regarding Keenan , Butler would say only that `` allegedly , she was shooting at our sign out there . '' 
Butler bought the land off Rimrock Road about 10 miles north of Coeur d'Alene for his compound back in 1972 , when he was in California working for Lockheed . 
The road winds over hills , past horse farms , fields of fresh-cut alfalfa and creeks where kids fish , a sea of tranquility interrupted by the jarring red , white and blue Aryan Nations sign at the foot of Butler 's property . 
Passing beneath the two flags at the entrance , one the Confederate stars and bars , the other a 13-star U.S. flag , the driveway climbs past a meadow of flowers until it rounds a corner , where a `` whites only '' sign precedes an empty guardhouse . 
The grounds resemble any of the other small retirement ranches nearby , except for the big brown stage in the middle of the compound , and a big Nazi swastika on a corrugated roof . 
In Butler 's Aryan heyday , the compound was a popular mecca for racist sympathizers from around the world who assailed whole groups of people , seeking to unify neo-Nazi forces . 
A `` who 's who of the hate movement '' visited the place over the years , including William Pierce , author of a book about a race war called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam ; and Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance , who lost his house and possessions to a SPLC lawsuit . 
Last week , however , only seven or eight people were living on or visiting the compound . 
Butler holds court at Richard Girnt Butler 's desk , piled with papers , in a small office next to the church . 
Gifts and framed documents hang on Richard Girnt Butler 's office walls , including several pictures of Butler . 
Beneath his desk , his 5-year-old purebred German Richard Girnt Butler 's , Fritz , instinctively growls at strangers . 
Fritz follows Butler everywhere , sometimes joining another Richard Girnt Butler 's , Eva , roaming the grounds . 
A picture of a sharp-featured Richard Girnt Butler peers across the doorway at a softer , glowing rendition of a Jesus with European features . 
There are lots of swastikas , one made by a follower in prison from folded Camel cigarette filters ; another crocheted , and another made of folded chewing-gum wrappers . 
Among his favorite gifts is a line of carved `` little Klansmen . '' 
Behind his chair , above a whip sent by an admirer and a Nazi helmet , is a tot 's drawing , orange silhouettes of a Klansman pasted on yellow paper , with blue crayon scribbling . 
It was made by the daughter of Christian , Richard Girnt Butler 's receptionist . 
`` I did n't even teach her that , '' Christian says proudly , `` Richard Girnt Butler just did it . 
It was pretty neat . '' 
Like his idol Hitler , Butler likes kids . 
A school once operated on the property but no more , though kids sometimes attend church with their parents . 
Race is a religion with Butler . 
The 150-year-old ideology known as Christian Identity , which has the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory through which Butler believes that Butler and others of white northern European descent are the true Israelites tricked out of their birthright by Jews , and forced to live with other races . 
Not everyone can understand the message of his race-based Christian Identity religion , Butler says . 
Jesus Christ people are like radio receivers in their ability to hear the message , says Butler . 
`` Jesus said let those who have ears hear . '' 
Among Butler 's more startling hypotheses : Whites , not American Indians , were the first in the Americas . 
And Albert Einstein was brilliant only because Jesus Christ was taught by Germans . 
He dislikes televangelists and spits out the word `` Judeo-Christian '' to describe the followers of mainstream Christian faiths . 
Even followers of the World Wide Church of the Creator , white separatists , are heretics in that they have compiled their own Bible instead of relying on the original , he says . 
How would Butler explain Richard Girnt Butler 's reverence for Hitler and the swastika to those thousands of World War II veterans lying in Normandy graveyards , who died fighting what those symbols stood for ? 
`` A lot of World War II soldiers now realize the war was a war against the white race and the white race lost , '' Butler asserts . 
Butler , born in Bennett , Colo. , on Feb. 23 , 1918 , is proud of his own German extraction , and says the war should never have been fought on the European theater . 
A profile of Butler by the SPLC says Richard Girnt Butler 's father , Clarence , a German-English machinist , did not hide Richard Girnt Butler 's dislike for Jews or communists from Richard Girnt Butler 's son . 
When the family moved to East Los Angeles after the Depression , Butler studied aeronautical engineering and science at a city college . 
Richard Girnt Butler then got a part-time job at 25 cents an hour at an aircraft company that sent him to Bangalore , India , to overhaul planes for the Royal Indian Air Force . 
Butler and Richard Girnt Butler 's wife , Betty , who died in December 1995 , were married in 1941 . 
During the war , Butler said Richard Girnt Butler enlisted in the Army Air Corps and taught aircraft hydraulics to mechnics in the China-Burma theatre . 
Butler said Richard Girnt Butler never agreed with fighting Germany , and was invigorated by newsreels of marching Germans . 
His racial activism , Richard Girnt Butler said , began after returning from the war when `` things just did n't seem right '' and Richard Girnt Butler became an admirer of Sen. Joe McCarthy 's movement about communism . 
Butler 's activism was galvanized during a signature campaign to expose communist teachers , when Richard Girnt Butler met William Potter Gale , a retired Army colonel who had served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's staff , who introduced Butler to Christian Identity . 
Butler also met George Lincoln Rockwell , a former Navy pilot who founded the American Nazi Party . 
Through Gale , Butler said Richard Girnt Butler met and studied under `` my mentor , '' Dr. Wesley Swift , pastor of the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation in Lancaster , Calif. , whose Christian Identity preaches that Eve mated with the devil , begetting Jews . 
Now Butler is preparing to pass the torch , but not in the heavily mentored fashion in which Richard Girnt Butler was ordained . 
Butler last year appointed an heir apparent , Butler , a longtime Aryan follower from Escondido , Calif. , and the latest in a string of annointed successors who faded away over the years in philosophical differences . 
His compound could disappear even without the lawsuit . 
In January , one of Butler 's two daughters , who do n't share Richard Girnt Butler 's neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs , said she and her husband would sell the 19-acre site , worth about $ 200,000 , upon Richard Girnt Butler 's death . 
When he bought the compound in 1972 , Butler hoped it would be the genesis of a white homeland , something Richard Girnt Butler 's Christian Identity beliefs claim white people have been denied . 
Even if the compound does n't survive , Richard Girnt Butler 's confident in Richard Girnt Butler 's racist religion . 
`` It 's all pre-ordained . 
There 's no way you can jump off of a cliff and not proceed to the judgment that you will hit the ground . 
You ca n't stop halfway . ''
