Amnesty International gave its backing Friday to Malayasia 's jailed former deputy prime minister , Anwar Ibrahim , saying that Anwar Ibrahim was a `` prisoner of conscience . '' 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohhamad dismissed Anwar on Sept. 2 and Anwar was arrested on Sunday . 
Fourteen of Anwar Ibrahim 's associates have also been detained , Amnesty International said . 
`` Anwar and Anwar Ibrahim 's associates are prisoners of conscience detained solely for non-violently calling for political reforms and for holding different opinions to the prime minister , '' Amnesty International said . 
`` By misusing Malaysia 's laws to detain political opponents , Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal standards on freedom of expression , the right to a fair trial and the treatment of detainees , '' the organization added .
