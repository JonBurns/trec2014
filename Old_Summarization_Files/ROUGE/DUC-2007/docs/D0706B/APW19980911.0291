Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by Chuan Leekpai 's top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government 's takeover . 
Army Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro is scheduled to visit Myanmar , also known as Burma , from Sept. 15-18 . 
It will be Chuan Leekpai 's final trip to Thailand 's western neighbor as Chuan Leekpai is scheduled to retire this year . 
Myanmar , also known as Burma , has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962 . 
The current military government came to power on Sept. 18 , 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement . 
The All Burma Students Democratic Front asked Chuan in a letter on Friday to urge the army chief to reschedule Chuan Leekpai 's trip . 
`` Thailand is a democratic country and the military government in Burma killed many people in 1988 . 
Recently they have arrested nearly a thousand members of opposition parties , '' said Aung Naing Oo , chairman of the ABSDF . 
Chuan Leekpai said Chetta Thanajaro 's trip would create a negative image for the Thai government and the Myanmar military would use the visit for propaganda .
