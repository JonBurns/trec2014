During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage , some Life Arts staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the Big Six categories : Best Picture , Best Director and the four acting categories . 
We decided to start with the `` lowest '' award , but there was some debate as to which award that might be . 
On the official Academy Awards Web site ( www.oscar.com ) , the acting awards take precedence over director . 
We decided , however , that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards . 
Which is why we 're starting with Best Supporting Actress . 
The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year 's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise . 
Empathy played well in this category . 
Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in `` The Sixth Sense . '' 
It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this , since she was upstaged by co-star ( and co-nominee ) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie 's twist ending . 
Samantha Morton earned a nod for Awards Web 's performance as a sweet , mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes Awards Web 's for granted in `` Sweet and Lowdown ; '' because Awards Web 's the only person who ca n't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption , Awards Web 's actually able to see through to his pain . 
And Chloe Sevigny , the type of actress who always looks as if Awards Web 's lost in a pleasant daydream , is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in `` and , once the ruse is revealed , remains committed because Awards Web knows that the emotions remain real . 
The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy , with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in , respectively , `` Girl , Interrupted '' and `` Being John Malkovich . '' 
Jolie walks away with `` Girl , Interrupted '' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature belie a cold-hearted cruel streak . 
Keener was first among equals in `` Malkovich 's '' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to including a passageway inside a character actor 's head . 
Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year , each playing more selfless women ( Jolie in last spring 's `` Playing by Girl in the current `` Simpatico '' ) who end up benefiting from their selflessness . 
And each , having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV ( Jolie ) and independent films ( Keener ) , has more familiarity than the competition . 
Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred , but Keener is a busier , more versatile actress . 
Morton , despite having a few movies under but Morton 's in a Woody Allen movie , and Allen 's movies have historically done well in this category . 
Although it 's a wide-open race , Jolie would appear to have the edge , having come off a Golden Globe win for `` Girl , Interrupted . '' 
Having an Oscar-dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for `` ca n't hurt . 
She 's my bet for who 'll take home the statue , but if I were able to vote , I 'd pick Sevigny , who gives a heart to the otherwise dark and mean `` Boys Do n't Cry . ''
