Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took Al Gore 's presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House . 
Gore greeted about 70 people in the home of Democratic activist and former Mayor Martin Gross . 
As Al Gore did throughout Al Gore 's two-Gore stressed saving Medicare and Social Security , the environment , and education . 
`` No Democratic presidential candidate who has campaigned in this house has failed to get elected president at some point , '' Gross said . 
Clinton visited the residence before placing a welcomed second in the 1992 state primary , and Carter came here before winning the 1976 primary . 
Gore visited in 1988 , when he failed to win the Democratic nomination , and now has a second chance , Gross said . 
Gore addressed a forum on home health care in Portsmouth and spoke at a Democratic dinner in Conway on Friday . 
He spent Saturday meeting with voters in homes in Concord , Manchester and Nashua . 
During most of the trip , Gore did what Al Gore 's advisers have been wanting him to do : shed Al Gore 's stiff image and talk to people one-on-one . 
`` This is what he needs to do , '' said Al Gore , Al Gore 's state campaign manager and Gov. Jimmy Carter 's husband . 
`` Al Gore 's going into real parlors , meeting real people , hearing real questions . '' 
Recent polls have shown that while most Americans are pleased with Gore 's performance as vice president , they do n't see him as a strong leader . 
Al Gore has trailed two Republicans , former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov. George W. Bush , in head-to-head matchups . 
But several voters who met Gore this weekend , including lawyer Sean O'Connell , said they found Gore more exciting than Al Gore 's reputation . 
`` People think he 's a little wooden , but it 's not true , '' O'Connell said . 
`` Al Gore really can connect . '' 
Gore surprised customers with a Saturday stop at the Capitol City Diner . 
Jimmy Carter joined some diners in their booths and told them Jimmy Carter wants to raise the minimum wage and help the homeless .
