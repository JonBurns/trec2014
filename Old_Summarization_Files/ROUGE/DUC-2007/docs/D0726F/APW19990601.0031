Vice President Al Gore received the endorsement of Al Gore 's boss ' wife Tuesday as Al Gore sought to rally women behind Al Gore 's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination . 
`` Al Gore has been out in front for women , for families , for children , throughout Al Gore 's life , '' Hillary Rodham Clinton told several hundred women at a downtown hotel . 
`` Now is the time for all of us to be out in front for him . 
Al Gore is my choice and I hope your choice for the next president of the United States . '' 
Gore will officially announce Al Gore 's candidacy for the nation 's top job on June 16 in Carthage , Tenn. , according to spokesman Roger Salazar . 
That is the site of the Gore family farm . 
Women are expected to play a pivotal role in the 2000 elections and Gore is seeking to inherit the support that President Clinton had enjoyed among them . 
His focus on family issues helped him win the women 's vote 55 percent to 37 percent in 1996 . 
But in a head-to-head matchup with Texas Gov. George W. Bush , 52 percent to 42 percent , according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in late May . 
Women were about equally split in that poll on whether Gore has the vision to solve the nation 's problems . 
By a 50 percent to 32 percent margin , they said they were less likely to vote for Gore if Clinton actively supports and campaigns for him . 
At the rally , Gore talked about Al Gore 's pride in cosponsoring , as a senator , the bill that was the first signed into law under the Clinton-the Family and Medical Leave Act , which gives workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of a new children , a seriously ill family member or personal illness . 
He promised additional family-friendly policies as president . 
`` I have listened to working families and I know our work is not done , '' Gore said as the mostly female crowd waved `` Gore 2000 '' placards or mini-American flags . 
Gore said Al Gore wants to extend the family leave law `` so parents can meet with their children 's teacher without fearing the loss of their job . '' 
He also talked about making preschool available to every child , reducing class sizes , allowing parents to pay for college tuition `` tax-free and inflation-free '' and using new technologies to tailor learning to individual children . 
Tipper Gore noted the importance of women to Al Gore 's husband 's campaign . 
`` As we know from past elections , when women vote Democrats win , '' she said . 
`` We need your help to share with the country his vision and we need your help to get the word out about his commitment ... on the issues that matter . '' 
A partial list of female supporters distributed by the Gore 2000 campaign names members of Congress , former governors , other state officials and mayors . 
Among those on stage with Gore were Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of D-Texas ; Del. 
Eleanor Holmes Norton , D-D.C ; Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Carol Browner , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency .
