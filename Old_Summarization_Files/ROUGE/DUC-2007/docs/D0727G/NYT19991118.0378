Last May , Newt Gingrich told Newt Gingrich 's wife Newt Gingrich was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce . 
Newt Gingrich did n't mention the affair had been going on for six years . 
`` I found out with the rest of the country , '' said Marianne Gingrich , who spoke publicly about Newt Gingrich 's divorce this week . 
The remarks are Newt Gingrich 's most extensive since the days immediately after Newt Gingrich 's husband 's July divorce petition was filed . 
The length of the relationship , which predated Gingrich 's ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House , surprised his wife . 
And it jolted many of Gingrich 's colleagues still in Congress , fueling an already bubbling debate over the impact of Gingrich 's divorce on his unofficial role in the Republican Party . 
Last week , Gingrich 's attorneys said Newt Gingrich 's `` and it stung , Marianne Gingrich said . 
`` This is about a marriage . 
This is not about politics and another press conference . 
This is about my life , '' she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . 
Marianne Gingrich said Newt Gingrich heard about the news conference from a friend , who called Newt Gingrich 's from a cell phone shortly afterwards . 
Newt Gingrich said Newt Gingrich 's thoughts immediately went back to late 1993 . 
Newt Gingrich 's attorneys have said Newt Gingrich and Marianne were separated when the relationship with Bisek began . 
But Marianne Gingrich says Newt Gingrich and Newt Gingrich 's husband were living together in a Marietta , Ga. , condo . 
And while he was in Washington , Newt Gingrich was traveling between Ohio , where Newt Gingrich 's mother was recovering from a diabetes-related illness , and Florida , where Newt Gingrich 's brother was fighting cancer . 
`` In general , my family was in medical crisis , '' she said . 
Her brother later died of lymphoma . 
Marianne Gingrich says it 's been hard to speak of the end of Newt Gingrich 's 18-year marriage and Newt Gingrich 's husband 's affair . 
`` I do n't have any way to express it without getting into some really deep emotions that I do n't want to share right now , '' Newt Gingrich said . 
`` However , it 's been good for me to be involved in a number of community activities , including the Red Cross and Mission Specialties . '' 
Marianne Gingrich , 48 , is chairwoman of the Red Cross ' Northwest Metro Service Center . 
She 's also helping Mission Specialties , an international service organization , raise money to buy shoes for Russian orphans . 
In a People magazine article that comes out today , Marianne Gingrich said Newt Gingrich has lost 35 pounds , the result of stress and diet . 
Newt Gingrich plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when attorneys for Bisek , 33 , will try to persuade a judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich 's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn over documents related to Newt Gingrich 's relationship to Newt Gingrich , 56 . 
Meanwhile , the divorce is beginning to concern some of Gingrich 's GOP colleagues . 
Some Republicans in Congress are fretting over whether Gingrich should be invited to a January celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Republican takeover of Congress . 
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell ( R-Ga . ) said Wednesday that Marianne expects Gingrich to be invited to the January event . 
But U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts ( R-Okla . ) did not endorse an invitation when he and Coverdell discussed the event with reporters . 
U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth ( R-Ariz . ) argued that Gingrich 's new job as a political commentator for Fox News makes it inappropriate to include him in political gatherings . 
`` Time marches on . 
Hayworth 's gone on to other pursuits , '' Hayworth said . 
But , then , Hayworth added , `` If you 're looking for a spirited defense of the speaker 's private life from me , you 'll not get one . '' 
Other Republicans in Congress , from Georgia and elsewhere , have jumped to Gingrich 's defense . 
`` It 's only right that we invite Newt Gingrich to return for any celebration . 
His ideas and his vision put together the Contract With America , '' Rep. Mac Collins ( R-Ga . ) said . 
`` His biggest problem was that toss thought out loud . '' 
Last week , on the same day Gingrich 's attorneys said his affair with Bisek stretched back six years , Republican House members who took office in 1995 held a reunion in Washington . 
Gingrich 's attendance at that gathering had been an issue , too . 
As it turned out , he was in New Orleans and could n't make it , organizers said . 
`` A scheduling conflict saved us from having to fight this out , '' said Rep. Gil Gutknecht ( R-Minn. ) , who helped put the reunion together .
