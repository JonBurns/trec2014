Responding to reports that the highly-touted anticancer drug endostatin has failed to impress in its first human tests , Dr. Judah Folkman of Children Hospital in Boston told thousands of cancer specialists Monday that Judah Folkman was `` very pleased '' with the drug 's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be more good news ahead . 
Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting , Folkman , who developed endostatin in Boston labs , urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs do n't work right away . 
`` It does n't matter if it takes a long time . . . , '' Folkman said . 
Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer specialists about the drug 's effectiveness since a National Cancer Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month saying `` no dramatic benefits , '' have been seen in endostatin trials going on now in Boston and two other cities . 
That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc. , which makes endostatin , into a tailspin . 
Investors have been closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman 's progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman would cure cancer within two years . 
That has n't happened but the enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented as they await results of the endostatin trials . 
Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study in October , two months ahead of the other centers , Folkman seemed to hint Monday that the drug 's effectiveness improves over time . 
Folkman , however , does not directly oversee the trials , from which no official data has been reported , and can not speak publicly about them . 
However , Judah Folkman said Monday `` We are very pleased with the results at the Boston hospital . '' 
He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called angiogenesis inhibitors , of which endostatin is one , have proved to be powerful cancer fighters . 
Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly , angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor 's blood supply and slowly strangles them , or at least halts their growth . 
Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients , mostly children , the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them . 
`` If we 'd given up in the first month or two , they would n't be around , '' he said . 
One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all therapies . 
She had been `` sent home to die , '' Folkman said , but after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor , the growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer . 
The patient , Tonya Kalesnik , of Colchester , may be alive only because Tonya Kalesnik 's doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt Tonya Kalesnik 's tumor 's growth . 
In a telephone interview Monday , Kalesnik said Tonya Kalesnik was in constant and excruciating pain , incontinent , and Tonya Kalesnik 's legs were increasingly numb as the tumor grew . 
Kalesnik 's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually prescribed interferon alpha , an infection-fighting substance that is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor . 
It is also effective in blocking a substance some tumors secrete , which signal the body to grow more blood vessels . 
Kalesnik 's tumor , called a giant cell tumor , was of a type that does n't spread through the body but kills through sheer size . 
Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it was n't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the tumor seemed to have stabilized . 
`` It was the first time it had done something other than grow , '' said Kalesnik , who is taking a break from Judah Folkman 's freshman year at the University of Vermont . 
Over the next 18 months , the tumor shrank by about 80 percent , and Folkman believes Tonya Kalesnik may be able to stop taking the drug within a few months . 
Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly , in small doses over along periods of time , Folkman said the standard way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate . 
In other words , angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment , but treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer , he said . 
Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths , called Tonya Kalesnik . 
Folkman showed slides of infants with enormous , disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood vessels . 
These life-threatening growths , which also produce substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels , also responded well to interferon treatment , Tonya Kalesnik said . 
Previously , no other anticancer treatment had worked . 
Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer . 
Most have been inconclusive but some show promise that will be explored in wider testing .
