U.S. President Bill Clinton said Friday Bill Clinton will appeal a federal judge 's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress . 
Clinton said that Clinton was " disappointed . " 
" I intend to appeal it , " Clinton said of the ruling . 
" We ought to give the Supreme Court a chance to have their say on it . " 
" I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending and I hope very much we can sustain it and we have to appeal it , " Clinton told reporters as Clinton was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the nation . 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued Bill Clinton 's decision late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act , a new and still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal spending and the balance of power in government . 
The law , passed by Congress last year , allowed the president for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress . 
Previously , the president could only veto entire bills .
