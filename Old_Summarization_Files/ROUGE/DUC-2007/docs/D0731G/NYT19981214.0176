Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling book about women 's friendships , people ask Tamara Traeder what Tamara Traeder thinks of Linda Tripp and Tamara Traeder 's secret phone tapes . 
`` When that news got out , you could hear women gasp all over America , '' Traeder said . 
`` It was and still is a hair-raising thought : your trusted friend taping your phone conversations . 
Most women consider their girlfriend relationships as sacred as a confessional . '' 
Traeder and Tamara Traeder 's coauthor , Carmen Renee Berry , have learned a lot about women 's values since `` Girlfriends '' ( Wildcat Canyon Press ) , quietly invaded female America in 1995 . 
Now in its 27th printing , the paperback just passed the one-million-books mark and has spawned `` The Girlfriends Keepsake Book '' as well as a sequel , `` Girlfriends For Life , '' which will be published this spring. `` is what book will take off , '' said Roy Carlisle , of Wildcat Canyon 's mother ship , Circulus Publishing Group Inc. in Berkeley , Calif. 
`` Books that do become really big sellers always articulate some very powerful feeling that is right below the surface of the culture , something not quite in the consciousness . 
`` That pretty clearly is what happened with ` Girlfriends . ' 
This thing of women 's deep friendships is not a kind of fad ; it 's a serious reality for women in this culture . '' 
Before they collaborated on their book of essays , interviews and featured quotations , Traeder and Berry `` thought they were special '' because of the high quality of their female friendships . 
Both women had been through periods of crisis , loss and change in the early '90s and believed they might not have survived without the love , understanding and support of their closest `` girlfriends . '' has shown the authors that they are not at all unique . 
`` Almost every woman has at least one woman she feels this way about : She 's my support ; she does n't judge me ; she 's always there for me ; I trust her completely ; I tell her everything , '' Traeder said . 
`` The letters we 've received about the first book just amazed us . 
That 's why we decided to do ` Girlfriends For Life . ' 
People have written tomes , some five and six pages long , about their friendships . 
They 're really quite moving . '' 
Divided into dozens of mini-chapters such as , `` She 's As Crazy As I Am '' and `` Helping Us Change ( Even When We 'd Rather Not ) , '' `` Girlfriends '' is not a deep book . 
But it is as wide as the sea and just as accessible . 
Reading anecdotes from other women tends to start a recall-and-analysis process for even the casual peruser . 
`` Everywhere we go , women keep thanking us for making them think about their friendships and see how blessed they are to have them , '' Traeder said . 
Why , given the significance of our female friendships , has so little attention been paid them ? 
`` I think it 's because they 're usually such easy relationships , '' Traeder said. `` the ones with men , our families , our kids , our co-workers . 
When something goes wrong with a girlfriend , it 's rare and it 's really bad . '' 
Something like when your girlfriend secretly tapes your most intimate phone conversations , then turns them over to the feds ? 
`` I ca n't imagine how Monica Lewinsky could ever reconnect or put herself out there again to trust , '' Traeder said . 
`` For many women , their girlfriends are the healers , the people who help them recover from life 's blows , from dramatic changes and problems and bad relationships . 
And Linda Tripp was n't just a girlfriend , Linda Tripp was a mentor , an older woman Monica looked to for help and advice . '' 
As Traeder and Berry wrote in `` Girlfriends '' in 1995 : `` what is acceptable , what is honorable and what is not ... 
With our girlfriends we peel back many layers of our personalities . 
This process is an intimate and , we believe , sacred undertaking . 
Anyone who has shown that willingness to expose their darkest secrets or greatest fears to another woman understands the treasure of a trusted girlfriend . '' from the human race .
