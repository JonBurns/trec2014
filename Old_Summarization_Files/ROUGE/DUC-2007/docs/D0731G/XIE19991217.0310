Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky appeared Thursday in a court in Maryland state of the United States and testified against Monica Lewinsky 's former confidant Linda Tripp . 
Lewinsky testified that Lewinsky felt violated to learn Tripp had secretly recorded Lewinsky 's intimate conversations about Lewinsky 's affair with President Bill Clinton and the telephone talks appeared in a magazine . 
" It terrified me , " Lewinsky said at a pretrial hearing for Tripp . 
" I was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being revealed . " 
The tapes that revealed her relationship with Clinton had led to the impeachment of President Clinton . 
Lewinsky 's testimony will determine whether Tripp stands trial on state wiretapping charges . 
Lewinsky said Lewinsky was sure the taped conversation actually took place on December 22 , 1997 . 
The date is crucial to the case against Tripp as Lewinsky is charged only with making the tape on that date and allowing it to be played for Newsweek magazine although Lewinsky made more than 20 hours of tapes . 
Tripp is charged with one count of making a tape recording of conversation with Lewinsky on December 22 after Monica Lewinsky had been informed that it was illegal to do so in Maryland and another count of turning that tape to a Newsweek reporter . 
If convicted on the two criminal charges , Tripp could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 20,000 dollars . 
Thursday 's testimony was Lewinsky 's opportunity to get back at Lewinsky 's former friend Tripp . 
As the investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Cliton 's sex scandal wrapped up in 1998 , Lewinsky said tearfully that " I hate Linda Tripp " at a federal grand jury testimony . 
Tripp , a Pentagon employee , did not appear at the hearing but her son , Ryan Tripp , watched Lewinsky testify .
