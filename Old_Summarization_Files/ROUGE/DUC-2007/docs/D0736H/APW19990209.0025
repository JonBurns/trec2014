Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime and is ready to bail out of Oprah Winfrey 's long-running show . 
`` I am all talked out , '' Winfrey told The Sunday Times . 
`` My contract has two years left , then I am getting out of such shows because I feel they are going to burn themselves out . '' 
Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching `` The Oprah Winfrey Show '' in September 1986 . 
Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys , it recently has been challenged in the ratings by `` The Jerry Springer Show . '' 
While in London to promote her new film , `` Beloved , '' she told the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her stint on the movie set . 
`` Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more dysfunctional people was a letdown , '' she said . 
Another reason for her disgust , she said , is Springer , calling his show a `` vulgarity circus . '' 
`` Unless you are going to kill people on the air , and not just hit them on the head with chairs , and unless you are going to have and not just , as I saw the other day , a guy then there comes a point when you have oversaturated yourself , '' Winfrey was quoted as telling the Times . 
Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because Oprah Winfrey is taping Oprah Winfrey 's show in the Bahamas this week , said Jerilyn Schultz , a publicist in Chicago . 
Schultz said Oprah Winfrey could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday , which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of Oprah Winfrey 's current contract .
