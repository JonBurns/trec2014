During a press conference Tuesday , Jerry Seinfeld was asked what it was like to end the run of Jerry Seinfeld 's hit comedy series . 
`` Do you ever take a dog into the park and take his leash off , and he kind of looks up at you for a second and then just bolts like a maniac ? '' he asked . 
`` Something like that . '' 
Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld wo n't do another TV series , but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again , Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform , one final time , the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld 's career . 
Tonight , Seinfeld is going to bury the act with a live HBO special called `` I 'm Telling You for the Last Time . '' 
( It 's tape delayed on the West Coast . ) 
The comedian has vowed that after tonight 's performance he would `` never do any of these jokes again , '' and said he plans to start working on an all-new act , though it may take eight months to a year , `` depending on how hard I work . '' 
In the last few weeks , Seinfeld has been polishing Jerry Seinfeld 's show on a tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland , Australia , England , Kansas City and Des Moines . 
Jerry Seinfeld made an unpublicized appearance at the Comedy Magic Club in Hermosa Beach a few weeks ago . 
On Wednesday , Jerry Seinfeld began a 10-performance run at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway that ends with tonight 's show . 
As for why he decided to tour rather than take some time off , Seinfeld said it was much more appealing than the usual vacation . 
`` To be in front of an audience is the most fun I can have , '' he said . 
`` I 've been on beaches . 
I 've been on boats . 
It 's pleasant , but it 's not really a lot of fun . '' 
Seinfeld is clearly enjoying himself on this tour , and performing before Jerry Seinfeld 's hometown crowd in New York City is especially rewarding . 
`` New York audiences have always been the best for me , because humor is really a New York invention , as far as I 'm concerned , '' he said . 
Seinfeld is n't likely to pull any surprises tonight , though reports say the material varies slightly from show to show . 
Jerry Seinfeld is at heart a Borscht Belt-style stand-up comedian who polishes Jerry Seinfeld 's material to a brilliant shine ; Jerry Seinfeld 's strength is wry , witty observations . 
You 'll see no wild , raw improv antics a la Robin Williams . 
Neither will Jerry Seinfeld go into a prolonged character , as Billy Crystal or Whoopi Goldberg do in their acts . 
Seinfeld is most comfortable being himself . 
Jerry Seinfeld did , as you remember , play a character for nine years named Jerry Seinfeld on Jerry Seinfeld 's hit series . 
The comedian 's schtick , for the most part , is Jerry Seinfeld 's puzzlement and amusement over the absurdities of modern life . 
And Jerry Seinfeld 's look at the end of a joke , which combines a slight bewilderment at the ridiculousness of a situation along with a bit of smug superiority because Jerry Seinfeld 's aware of it , is what endears him to audiences who feel the same way. ( `` Oh yeah , '' you 're thinking as you 're laughing , `` I noticed that . '' ) The reviews of the tour and the Broadway performances have been mostly positive . 
And even if the material is likely to be familiar to fans , it is n't likely to stop anyone from laughing . 
One Midwest critic started off by carping that a better title for the concert would be `` Do n't Stop Me If You 've Heard This One , '' but throughout the rest of the review repeated a lot of the show 's jokes ( we wo n't do that ) and talked about how much the audience enjoyed itself . 
Makes sense . 
`` Seinfeld '' reruns in syndication do handsomely . 
Good jokes , after all , are hard to find , which makes tonight 's show , if Seinfeld keeps his promise , a keeper for anyone with a VCR . 
( It will be repeated at 9:30 p.m. 
Sept. 12 . ) 
For those of you who do n't , the material will also be included on his upcoming Universal Records album of the same name . 
Oh , by the way , one of the people watching those syndicated reruns is Seinfeld himself . 
`` I thought they were very funny , the ones that I saw , '' he said . 
`` I found them very , very entertaining . 
I was upset that the show went off the air when I saw them . ''
