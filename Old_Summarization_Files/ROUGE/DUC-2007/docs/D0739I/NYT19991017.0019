That pretty much sums up Larry David : Curb Your Enthusiasm . 
The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness . 
One crucial difference : Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David 's famous no-hugging , no-learning rule of television . 
`` There was some hugging at the end of the show , '' David said in a conference call . 
`` It was as insincere as you could get . 
Insin cere hugging is al lowed . '' 
Although David , who penned some of Seinfeld 's most darkly brilliant ep isodes , is more or less the model for George Costanza , George Costanza is also a former stand-up comedian himself . 
George Costanza had n't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that George Costanza was thinking about giv ing it another shot . 
`` He said , ` You should film it , ' '' David said . 
`` Like everything else , I was reluctant at first . 
The more people I asked about it , everyone seemed to think it was a good idea . 
I thought it was a way to motivate me to get on stage . '' 
However , he was n't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format . 
`` I wanted to do something different , '' he said , `` rather than the straight stand-up show . 
Then , I started to think I needed some other stuff in there , what we were going to do offstage . 
We could n't just follow me around the supermarket shopping , so I had to come up with some stuff . '' 
`` Some stuff ' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show , with the stand-about David 's return to stand-up . 
`` It 's not totally mock , '' David said , stressing that revealing just what is real and what is n't would spoil the fun for viewers . 
`` Certainly , the stand-up is real . 
I would say that there are elements in there that are real . 
Most of it 's embellished , but some of it 's real . '' 
Part of the genuineness , David said , is Larry David 's person ality . 
`` It 's not that much of a character , '' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen . 
`` I 'm not re ally stretching there . 
That 's pretty much who I am . '' 
That Larry David wanders around a good bit , mumbling about life and its foibles , sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled , balding , chunky , self-proclaimed loser from a late , great hit TV series . 
`` I really resent that ` who 's call ing ? ' '' he says while making a phone call . 
`` Like some people are good enough to make the cut . '' 
Jason Alexander , who played George on Seinfeld , makes an ap pearance , commenting on David . 
So does Jerry himself , who relates that during Jerry 's early stand-up days , Da vid referred to the audience as `` you people . '' 
Other comedians show up , as well , including Richard Lewis . 
`` He was a Larry David says of David . 
`` He just could n't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people . '' 
David called Larry David 's stand-up career `` the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship . '' 
`` It 's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it 's not going well , you blame it on the au dience , '' he said . 
`` You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent . 
`` When it 's going well , you think that you 're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody 's brilliant. . . . 
It 's very extreme thinking . '' 
Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since Larry David has been onstage . 
Of course , David 's life has changed as well . 
Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man , in deed . 
But that 's the only change , Larry David said . 
`` I 'm pretty much the same , but I can get dental work in my house now , '' he said . 
`` That 's the difference . '' 
David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes , and the show lost its dark New York heart , which made it so funny . 
Larry David famously returned for the series-ending show , which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV 's biggest flops . 
David naturally begs to differ . 
`` I could n't be more pleased with it , '' he said of the final episode . 
`` First of all , the fact that so many people did n't like it ? 
I loved that . 
It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish . '' 
Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm , because it 's far funnier than Seinfeld 's finale . 
Then again , how could it not be ?
