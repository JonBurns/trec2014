Police always suspected Mark Barton was at the end of the bloody trail that led out the door of the travel trailer where Mark Barton 's wife and mother-in-law were hacked to death in 1993 . 
Barton had the motive , they believed : a $ 600,000 life insurance policy on Mark Barton 's wife and a girlfriend on the side . 
Investigators knew Mark Barton had a temper and an opportunity to kill . 
But Barton denied Mark Barton did it , and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him : proof Mark Barton had ever been to the camper where Debra Barton and her mother , Eloise Spivey , were slain . 
`` We did n't have any witnesses who could put him there , '' said Mark Barton , an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney 's office . 
`` We did n't have any fingerprints . '' 
Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday , injuring 13 others . 
Afterward , Mark Barton 's wife and two children were found dead in their apartment . 
They had been beaten with a hammer . 
In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County , Ga. , Barton acknowledged that the murders of Barton 's family were similar to the Alabama killings , in which police believe the victims were killed with a hatchet . 
But Barton , writing that `` there 's no reason for me to lie now , '' continued to deny committing the ' 93 killings . 
In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage , Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the ' 93 killings but believed they did all they could . 
Barton was the only suspect ever considered . 
`` I do n't know of anything we could have done differently , '' Smith said . 
`` We knew morally that he had done it , but we could not prove it legally . '' 
The women were found dead on Sept. 5 , 1993 , inside a blood-splattered trailer at a campground along Weiss Lake . 
As many as 600 people were at the campground when the women were killed . 
Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door , but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe , taking away one possible link to Barton . 
Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day , but no one remembered seeing Barton . 
Early tests on Barton 's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat. claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle , ruining any potential evidence , Smith said . 
Another investigator involved in the case , speaking on condition of anonymity , said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave `` rehearsed '' answers during an interview . 
He also refused a polygraph test . 
It was only after that , the source said , that officers found out about the $ 600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was killed . 
Investigators believe Barton , involved with another woman , came to Alabama to ask Mark Barton 's for a divorce and Mark Barton refused , prompting the killings . 
Smith said the insurance company , Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska , offered to pay the full amount of the policy , provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple 's two children . 
Barton refused and eventually settled . 
Court records show the insurer paid $ 450,000 on the policy , with $ 150,000 of that going into trust for Barton 's children and the remainder going to Barton and lie now 's lawyers . 
Michael Hauptman , Barton 's criminal lawyer , who was not involved in the civil case , said lie now believed the lawyers got about $ 100,000 . 
Alabama authorities said they did n't know whether Barton 's second wife , Leigh Ann Barton , was the woman Barton had been dating during Barton 's first marriage . 
However , her ex-husband , David Lang , told the New York Daily News that Mark Barton was , and he said he believes Mark Barton helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy . 
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday . 
Smith said that after Barton remarried , lie now would periodically call the investigator and ask why lie now was a suspect in the slayings . 
`` It was a game to him . 
He got mad at me one time because he could n't convince me he did n't do it , '' Mark Barton said . 
Once , Smith said , `` He told me that he would never go to jail . '' 
Barton was good to Mark Barton 's word . 
Mark Barton committed suicide hours after the Atlanta rampage as they closed in on him .
