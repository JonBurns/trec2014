Mass killer Mark O. had been worried for Mark O. 's safety but loved Barton 's children and wanted to continue to be involved in their lives , Mark O. 's sister said Saturday . 
`` I 'm sorry it happened to my sister but I 'm not surprised , '' said Dana Reeves , Leigh Ann Barton 's older sister . 
`` I 've felt that this has been coming for a couple of years . '' 
When Barton killed Dana Reeves 's 27-year-old wife with a hammer Tuesday , it was the beginning of the bloodiest mass killing in Atlanta 's history . 
The next night he killed his two children from a previous marriage as they slept in the family 's suburban apartment . 
The slayings were discovered Thursday when Barton , a chemist turned day stock-trader , walked into the offices of two brokerage firms and fired randomly at traders and employees . 
Nine died and 13 were wounded , with four still in critical condition Saturday . 
Hours later , Barton killed himself as police pulled over Dana Reeves 's van . 
The first funeral was Friday for Allen Charles Tenenbaum , a 48-year-old father of three . 
The grocer was gunned down while trading at All-Tech Investment Group . 
Dean Mohammed Delawalla , 52 , of Atlanta was buried Saturday after a one-hour , 15-minute Islamic service at a funeral home in suburban Lilburn . 
A spokeswoman for the family , Zeenat Hussain , estimated that 2,000 attended the service , much of which took place on the asphalt parking lot with the media looking on from a nearby hill . 
`` Dean was a very devoted member of this community , '' Ms. Hussain said . 
A private memorial service was held in Buckhead for family members of the victims . 
Afterwards , relatives of one of the dead , Edward Quinn , walked solemnly down Piedmont Road to the building where Mark O. was killed . 
There , they said prayers and placed flowers . 
Services for Mrs. Barton were scheduled for Sunday . 
Ms. Reeves , who lives in Macon , said Dana Reeves 's sister left Barton in October , in part because Dana Reeves was frustrated after supporting Dana Reeves 's jobless husband for about a year . 
Dana Reeves worked as a sales representative for a company that sells cleaning supplies . 
Ms. Reeves said she was wary of Barton after learning that his first wife and her mother had been hacked to death in Alabama in 1993 . 
Barton was the prime suspect in the slayings , but police said they never had enough evidence to charge him . 
`` There was never really a comfortable feeling with him after that , '' Ms. Reeves said in a telephone interview . 
Barton was having an affair with Mark O.-Leigh Ann Vandiver at the time of the Alabama slayings . 
If Barton killed Dana Reeves 's first wife , Ms. Reeves said , Reeves 's sister knew nothing of it . 
`` She 's just an innocent victim that something terrible has happened to , '' she said . 
Police found Mrs. Barton 's body covered with a blanket in a bedroom closet of the apartment . 
In a computer-printed suicide note Barton left for police , Dana Reeves said Dana Reeves was sorry for Dana Reeves 's wife 's murder . 
`` I killed Leigh Ann because Dana Reeves was one of the main reasons for my demise as I planned to kill the others , '' Barton wrote . 
`` I really wish I had n't killed Dana Reeves 's now . 
Dana Reeves really could n't help it and I love Dana Reeves 's so much anyway . '' 
Ms. Reeves said Dana Reeves 's sister would talk of fights with Barton , but would never answer directly when asked if Mark O. abused Dana Reeves 's . 
`` I know she had fears from him , '' she said . 
`` The last deep-down , heart-to-heart conversation we had , I asked her was she comfortable or scared . 
She said , ` Yes , but my apartment has this security system and that makes me feel comfortable . '' ' 
The couple separated in October but Mrs. Barton allowed Dana Reeves 's husband to move into Dana Reeves 's apartment a few weeks ago , Dana Reeves 's sister said . 
Dana Reeves , 11 , and Mark O. , 7 . 
She said Mrs. Barton treated the children as if they were her own , coaching Dana Reeves 's soccer team and leading Mark O. 's Brownie troop . 
`` I know she had some concerns about the kids , wanting to be with them and wanting to be involved in their life like she had been , '' she said . 
Ten shooting victims remained hospitalized after one woman was discharged Saturday from Grady Memorial Hospital . 
Four were in critical condition , including a 38-year-old woman shot in the temple and who may be blinded permanently .
