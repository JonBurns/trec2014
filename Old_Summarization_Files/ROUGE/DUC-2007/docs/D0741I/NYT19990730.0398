The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage . 
`` I 'm sure the details do n't matter . 
There is no excuse , no good reason . 
I am sure no one will understand . 
If they could I would n't want them to . 
I just write these things to say why , '' read a portion of the letter . 
In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday , Mark Orrin Barton described how Mark Orrin Barton killed Mark Orrin Barton 's estranged second wife , Leigh Ann Barton , 27 , with a hammer Tuesday , then beat and drowned Mark Orrin Barton 's two children the following day . 
`` Where the kids were ( the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was killed ) , I have absolutely no way of knowing , '' said Jimmy Mercer , chief of the Henry County Police , the agency investigating the three deaths in Stockbridge , near Atlanta . 
`` He went to pains to conceal the body so you ca n't help but think the kids were in and out during that time , '' Mercer said . 
Barton 's wife was found in a closet in the apartment home . 
Barton walked Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms where Mark Orrin Barton traded and fired randomly at traders and employees . 
Nine died and 13 were wounded . 
Hours later , Mark Orrin Barton killed himself as police pulled over Mark Orrin Barton 's van . 
The letter indicates he killed his children from his first marriage , Mark Orrin Barton , 11 , and Michelle , 8 , to save them from a painful existence . 
Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993 . 
Although Barton was considered the prime suspect , Mark Orrin Barton was never charged in that case and denied any involvement in the letter Mark Orrin Barton left . 
The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his wife 's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday . 
He gave no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife and the people at the companies for his depression . 
Officials at one of the businesses , Momentum Securities , said Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning June 9 , and lost $ 105,000 . 
The other business , All-Tech Investment Group , would not release his trading history there . 
Barton made no reference to Mark Orrin Barton 's trading in the letter but mentioned Mark Orrin Barton 's plan to kill others twice . 
`` I do n't plan to live very much longer , just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction . 
You should kill me if you can , '' he wrote. his mother , Gladys Barton ; his children 's maternal grandfather , Bill Spivey ; and an attorney , Joe Fowler . 
At first authorities thought the three might be intended targets but later decided they were just people to contact about the deaths . 
After the shootings , Barton , 44 , shot himself to death in Mark Orrin Barton 's minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth , just north of Atlanta . 
The letter was found Thursday night lying on a coffee table in the living room of Barton 's estranged wife 's apartment in Stockbridge , about 30 miles south of Atlanta . 
Three handwritten notes also were found on each of the bodies . 
Each contained two sentences describing his love for each and asking someone to take care of them . 
Copies of the letter were not released , but Mercer read the letter to reporters Friday . 
`` This letter was left in a very obvious place , '' Mercer said . 
`` We did n't have to do any searching . 
They ( the letter and notes with each body ) were very visible from the time you walked in . '' 
The printed letter was addressed `` To Whom It May Concern . '' 
It began with a matter-of-fact tone : `` Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket . 
I killed her Tuesday night . 
I killed Matthew and Michelle Wednesday night . '' 
Barton wrote of the similarities between the deaths and those of Mark Orrin Barton 's first wife of 15 years , Debra Spivey Barton , 36 , and Jimmy Mercer 's mother , Eloise Powell Spivey , 59 . 
They were hacked to death six years ago in a camper at Lake Weiss , Ala. 
`` However I deny killing her and her mother . 
There is no reason for me to lie now , '' Barton wrote . 
`` It just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die . 
`` There was little pain . 
All of them were dead in less than five minutes . 
I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them facedown in the bathtub to make sure that they did not wake up in pain , to make sure they were dead . 
I am so sorry . 
I wish I did n't . 
Words can not tell the agony . 
Why did Leigh Ann Barton ? '' 
Barton wrote only that Mark Orrin Barton had `` been dying since October '' and since then had terrifying dreams Mark Orrin Barton could no longer live with . 
The letter never explained what caused the dreams or Mark Orrin Barton 's sense of hopelessness . 
He only wrote : `` It has taken its toll . 
I have come to hate this life in this system of things . 
I have come to have no hope . '' 
The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion . 
`` I killed the children to exchange for them five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain , '' he wrote . 
`` I forced myself to do it to keep them from suffering so much later . 
No mother , no father , no relatives . 
`` The fears of the father are transferred to the son . 
It was from my father to me and from me to my son . 
He already had it and now to be left alone , I had to take him with me . '' 
The bodies of the children were found in the other bedroom of the two-bedroom apartment . 
Each was lying in a separate bed with blankets and bed coverings pulled up to their faces . 
A handwritten note was lying on top of each bed . 
`` There was n't any part of the body aside from just a square portion of their face visible , '' Mercer said . 
`` It was almost like they were sleeping . 
There was certainly not any visible blood that I saw ... 
We saw some blood splatters on the wall , but it also appeared to be this individual went to some extreme in terms of trying to clean up the mess . '' 
The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of shrine in tribute to each . 
Next to Mark Orrin Barton 's body was a video game , and next to Michelle a stuffed toy . 
But Barton blamed Mark Orrin Barton 's wife in the letter . 
`` I killed Leigh Ann because Mark Orrin Barton was one of the main reasons for my demise , as I plan to kill the others . 
I really wish I had n't killed Mark Orrin Barton 's now . 
Mark Orrin Barton really could n't help it , and I love Mark Orrin Barton 's so much anyway . '' 
Several draft versions of the letter were found on the computer in the home , Mercer said . 
That Barton 's depression led him to kill at home and the workplace is unusual , said John Vincent , a professor of psychology at the University of Houston . 
`` It 's chilling to hear those words , '' Vincent said . 
`` This pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker . '' 
Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at Mark Orrin Barton 's expense . 
`` It 's a sense of somebody has to pay , '' Vincent said . 
Despite the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying , authorities there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and Eloise Spivey to be closed now . 
Barton had taken out a $ 600,000 in life insurance on Mark Orrin Barton 's first wife before her death and eventually settled with the insurance company for $ 450,000 , according to federal court records obtained by The Associated Press . 
About $ 150,000 was to be held in trust for Mark Orrin Barton 's children . 
After legal fees , Barton was left with $ 194,000 . 
The AP also reported that Barton lived in Texarkana , Texas , in the late 1980s and was fired from Jimmy Mercer 's job as president of TLC Manufacturing after a burglary investigation . 
One of the handguns Barton used in the spree , a Colt .45-caliber , was traced to a North Texas gun dealer , police said , and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983 . 
Barton registered the other , a 9 mm Glock , in 1993 . 
With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton 's shooting spree in Atlanta , Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities would continue to search for a motive . 
`` There will be a number of people for a long period of time trying to put the pieces to the puzzle together to find out why it is that Mr. Barton was provoked to the extent that Jimmy Mercer was , that Jimmy Mercer felt the need to take out as many people as Jimmy Mercer did , '' Mercer said . 
`` I do n't have those answers at this time and I doubt anyone else does either . ''
