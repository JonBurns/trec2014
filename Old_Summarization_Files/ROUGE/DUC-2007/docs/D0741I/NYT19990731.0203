While relatives of Mark O. struggled with questions and doubts of their own . 
Leigh Ann Barton 's grandmother , Pauline Vandiver , 78 , sat with family in the antique-packed living room of her home in Macon , Ga. , remembering the soft-spoken woman who was killed by a man they never quite trusted . 
As family and friends delivered foil-wrapped banana bread and a fruit basket tied with a yellow ribbon , the Vandivers struggled with whether they should have foreseen the carnage . 
Ginger Lewis , Leigh Ann Barton 's cousin , said the whole family was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his first wife , Debra Barton , and her mother , Eloise Powell Spivey . 
Several family members , including Lewis , thought Mark O. must have done it . 
`` I had to ride in the car with him all the way back to Macon , '' Lewis said , recalling Mark O. 's trip from the Atlanta wedding to Macon for a reception while Mark Barton 's children rode with Leigh Ann . 
`` I was so scared , you know , if he killed his wife . 
He did n't talk the whole time . 
Not one word . '' 
According to family members , Joe Vandiver told Mark O. 's daughter outright that Mark O. believed Mark Barton was guilty of the crimes . 
Leigh Ann insisted Mark O. was n't , family members said . 
On Saturday , Mother 's Day . 
They described her as lady-like with a Christian school background . 
And she never forgot a family event . 
But they also remembered a woman torn between a husband she wanted to leave and the children she wanted to stay with . 
Leigh Ann did n't want to have children , but Mark O. came to love Mark Barton 's son and daughter like they were Mark O. 's own , Mark O. 's grandmother said . 
`` Those kids thought more of her than they did him , '' great-uncle Larry Vandiver said of Leigh Ann , 27 , and Mark Barton , 44 . 
`` They called her Momma . '' 
`` She said , ` If I ever leave Mark I 'm going to take these kids , '' ' Pauline Vandiver recalled Mark O. 's granddaughter saying during the Mothers ' Day trip . 
In a note left for authorities , Barton said Mark O. killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed Pauline Vandiver 's body in a closet of Pauline Vandiver 's Stockbridge apartment . 
Barton said Mark O. killed Mark O. 's two children , Leigh Ann , 11 , Mark Barton , 8 , the next evening . 
One day later , Mark O. went on a shooting spree through two Buckhead office buildings . 
Leigh Ann Barton 's family learned with television viewers that Mark O. and the children were dead . 
They will bury Mark O. 's at 1 p.m. today in Macon . 
`` Reality 's setting in since they got the body home , '' said Vandiver . 
Meanwhile , with metro Atlantans trying to cope with the latest blast of violence , the sad parade of funerals and memorials continued . 
Pastors and rabbis were trying to draw some sense from these tragic events . 
And many people were gathering for comfort , healing and reflection on one man 's bizarre behavior . 
On Saturday , the friends and family of Dean Delawalla , 52 , gathered for his funeral services at the National Cremation Society Memorial Center in Lilburn . 
The former attorney and businessman , a devout Muslim , had been preparing for Debra Barton 's daughter Shahala 's birthday when Debra Barton was killed in the storm of bullets . 
A memorial service is set for today for Allen Charles Tenenbaum , a 48-year-old father of three . 
More than 1,000 people attended Mark O. 's funeral Friday . 
The memorial service will be at noon today at Congregation Or VeShalom , where Tenenbaum served as president . 
His chair at the pulpit will be covered for at least a month in Mark O. 's memory , said Jack Arogeti , vice president . 
`` Goodness was Mark O. 's nature , '' Arogeti said . 
The immense outpouring of sympathy for the nine people shot to death prompted the scheduling of a memorial service Saturday at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead. where the killings occurred . 
Funeral arrangements for Barton himself have been kept secret by the family . 
At the Henry County apartment where Barton killed Pauline Vandiver 's wife and two children , mourners placed a half-dozen small flower bouquets at the front door . 
`` Rest in Peace , Leigh Ann , Leigh Ann and Michelle , '' read a note left in a hanging basket outside . 
`` May God be with You , '' was the inscription on a torn peace of paper in a potted plant . 
During the day , the only activity inside the apartment was cleanup by a crime scene crew . 
Three employees of Metro Crime Scene Disposal spent three hours removing pillows and blankets . 
They also cut out sections of mattresses and carpet for transportation to medical incinerators . 
`` There was very little bloodshed '' at the apartment , said company representative Gordy Powell . 
Mark O. said the scene was consistent with Barton 's note describing how Mark O. beat the children unconscious , then drowned them . 
He described the apartment as a neat , `` middle-income family setting '' that reflected a woman 's taste in `` country decor . '' 
Among the possessions left behind , to be claimed by family members , were some Happy Meals toys . 
Neighbors said things are returning to normal at the apartment complex , as the numbers of sightseers and camera crews dwindled . 
At a gas station a mile from the Stockbridge apartment , a clerk who recognized Barton from news photos said he would frequently buy $ 1 or $ 2 worth of gas and complain in a serious tone that the station 's prices were too high . 
Some metro Atlanta religious leaders said they would discuss the slayings in services today . 
The Rev. Randy Stamper , considering what Pauline Vandiver may tell Pauline Vandiver 's assembly at Faith Free Full Gospel Church in Buford , commented on Barton : `` Some people seem to lose all hope , and they do n't have any major foundation in life but money . 
When Pauline Vandiver lost that , Pauline Vandiver lost it all . '' 
Meanwhile , Atlanta 's grief reached to Littleton , Colo. , where four months earlier 13 people were killed at Columbine High School . 
The two gun-crazed students , like Barton , also committed suicide . 
`` It 's one sickening tragedy after another , '' said Rick Castaldo , who moved with Mark O. 's second wife across the country to be with Mark O. 's 17-year-old son , Richard , left paralyzed from the Columbine attack . 
Even some people in the Denver area whose families were not directly affected by the Columbine shootings said a familiar wave of disbelief washed over them Thursday . 
`` It 's happening all over again in Atlanta and we still have no answers in Littleton , '' said Katryn Stienmark , who works for St. Frances Cabrini Catholic Church , the Littleton church where many families and students sought solace and several of the slain were eulogized . 
`` We 're thinking , ` My God ! '' ' 
In the meantime , 10 people injured in the shootings remain hospitalized , some in critical condition in intensive care units . 
One wounded victim was released from the hospital Saturday . 
Derek Schimming , a branch manager for All-Tech , said the four All-Tech employees still in the hospital are `` progressing . 
They 're still not out of the woods , but they 're doing better . ''
