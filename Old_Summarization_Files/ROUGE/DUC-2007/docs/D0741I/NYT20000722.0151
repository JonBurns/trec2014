A widow kept old sheets on the bed because they smelled like her husband . 
A former stock trader even fears going to the bank , worried that someone will shoot him again . 
A grandfather ca n't bear to visit the graves of his granddaughter and grandson , who flank his slain wife and daughter . 
One year ago , they faced unimaginable violence ; today , and perhaps forever , unfathomable sadness . 
All because of Mark Barton . 
On July 29 , 1999 , a year ago next Saturday , the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia 's history . 
During the previous two days , he had bludgeoned his wife and his two children . 
Later , as police surrounded his green minivan , Barton committed suicide . 
At the end , 13 people were dead . 
Another 13 were wounded . 
A year later , most of the survivors ' physical injuries have healed . 
The day-Momentum Securities Inc. and All-have reopened ; fresh paint , wallpaper and carpet cover the remnants of the carnage . 
Families of some victims have moved into new homes , trying to escape the memories . 
Lawsuits have been filed , relationships have frayed , counseling and antidepressants have failed to eliminate the pain . 
`` Every time I pray and read my Bible , Kevin 's kind of talking to me , '' Buddy Dial , a former All-Pro football player , said of Mark Barton 's slain son . 
`` It 's been very difficult , losing Kevin . '' `` but now I do it without my partner , '' said Roy Webb , whose son , Scott , was killed . 
`` I guess that feeling will never go away . '' 
Some who lived through the day 's horror , directly or indirectly , say they 've accepted what happened , and even gotten over their anger . 
Some wo n't talk about it at all , and others say they 've simply tried to put the event out of their minds . 
`` My whole stance is , it 's still in the past , '' said Scott Manspeaker , back to work as a manager at All-Tech after nearly bleeding to death from two gunshot wounds . 
`` We 're over it . '' 
`` I just do n't bring it up , '' said Ginger Lewis , a cousin of Barton 's slain wife , Leigh Ann . 
`` I can be driving down the road and I get a little flash of it and I feel like I 'm going to cry , but I tuck it away . 
That 's what I do with bad things . '' 
Still others have analyzed and reanalyzed everything that happened . 
They 've tried to reconstruct every moment of the tragedy , endlessly seeking some truth that will help it all make sense . 
What they find , though , are others asking the same question : Why ? 
`` Every week I or somebody I know runs into somebody who was touched by that incident , '' said Nell Jones , who eluded a bullet from Barton but witnessed Mark Barton 's rampage at All-Tech . 
`` It 's absolutely mind-boggling that one person could create that much sorrow . 
One person . '' 
` GOD TOOK AN ANGEL ' Marie Quinn wonders about Barton . 
Why did n't he just kill himself that day in Atlanta ? 
Why did he have to take so many with him ? 
And why kill 's husband , Edward ? 
`` I have so much anger in me , it 's unbelievable , '' Quinn said recently in the large brick house Mark Barton and Mark Barton 's husband built 14 years ago . 
`` Even though I go to counseling , I do n't think I 'll ever be able to let it all out . '' 
Nights are the hardest . 
`` I still have trouble going to bed , because I know Eddie wo n't be there , '' Mark Barton said . 
`` After he was killed , I waited a long , long time to change the sheets because they smelled like him . '' 
Her salvation , she said , has been her first grandson , Bryce . 
Mark Barton was born three months before her husband was killed , and the family treasures its photographs of grandfather and grandson . 
`` God took an angel , '' Mark Barton said , `` and , at the same time , gave us an angel . '' 
Like others who became widows last July 29 , Roya Havash has suffered from depression . 
Medication has helped , she said , but it has n't lessened her feeling that her husband , Jamshid , was n't supposed to be at All-Tech that day . 
In her husband 's personal effects she found a ticket from the toll booth on Ga. 400 near the shooting scene . 
He had passed through just 45 minutes before he was killed . 
`` I do believe in destiny , '' she said . 
`` We 're Muslim . 
The Quran said that when your time comes , you have to go . 
There 's nothing you can do about it. . . . 
In a way , I think it was Mark Barton 's time . 
But it was too soon . '' 
Gulshan Harjee thinks of what Mark Barton 's husband , Dean Delawalla , has missed the past 12 months . 
Their son , Faisal , turned 16 and learned to drive . 
Soon he 'll start visiting colleges . 
Their daughter , Shahla , turns 5 on Friday . 
Mark Barton birthday will always fall the day before the anniversary of Mark Barton 's father 's death . 
`` That 's the one thing we 'll live with every year , '' Harjee said . 
`` We need to reclaim the sadness of that day . . . because the children have to have their lives and move on . '' 
Debra Tenenbaum 's three children have given Mark Barton 's strength to deal with the loss of Mark Barton 's husband , Allen . 
But as they grow , she said , she realizes how much time has passed without her husband . 
One recent evening , her 4-year-old son , Scott , jumped up from the dinner table . 
`` I almost forgot what he looked like , '' he told his mother . 
SURVIVORS The last thing Kathleen Van Camp ever saw was Barton 's face . 
She was sitting in an office at All-once in the chest , once in the head . 
Immediately , her world went dark . 
In the year since , Van Camp said , Mark Barton has undergone `` many surgeries , '' and Mark Barton expects more . 
But she does not expect to regain her sight . 
`` I 'm weary , '' she said . 
`` I guess I 'm getting along . '' 
She takes classes at the Center for the Visually Impaired . 
She visits friends , dines out occasionally , follows the stock market , goes to doctors ' appointments . 
`` That 's pretty much it , '' she said . 
`` I do n't really want to go anywhere . '' 
Before the shooting , Van Camp enjoyed her independence . 
Now she relies on her husband of 13 years , Michael Sovereign , and others to take Scott 's everywhere . 
That loss of freedom , Scott said , has been the hardest adjustment . 
`` I was a really self-reliant person , '' she said , `` and suddenly I was n't . '' 
The only evidence of former day trader Sang Yoon 's wound is a scar along Mark Barton 's lower left forearm . 
But Mark Barton , too , has lost Mark Barton 's freedom . 
When he takes deposits from his dry cleaning business to the bank , he is afraid a shooting will erupt . 
During a recent power outage at his business , when he heard sounds from an electric pole , he thought they were shots . 
He took the rest of the day off . 
At home , he said , his temper is short . 
`` My wife says I 've changed , '' he said . 
`` When my baby is crying , I used to take care of that . 
But now I get angry . '' 
Sometimes , he feels a tickling sensation along his scar . 
Pointing to his heart , he said , `` I 'm still uncomfortable . '' 
A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP Mark Barton counted on Mark Barton 's son , Russell . 
When Mark Barton 's husband and oldest son had cancer , it was Russell who nursed them . 
And when something needed repairing at Mark Barton 's home in Florida , it was Russell who took care of it . 
Since Russell was killed at Momentum , Brown has sold her house . 
`` Everywhere I looked , I saw Russ , '' said Brown , who now lives near her daughter in Orlando . 
`` He was the project guy . 
He came down every other month to fix things around here for me . '' 
She never wants to visit Atlanta again , not even for a memorial service July 30 for Barton 's victims . 
Not even to see her son 's fiancee of eight years , Patti Balon . 
The Brown family has broken its ties with Balon after a disagreement over how to disperse Russell 's ashes. his clothes , furniture , ashes . 
Balon and the Brown family no longer speak to one another . 
Balon described the estrangement as unfortunate . 
She said she 's still grieving , but is working 70-hour weeks as a diversion . 
`` I put it on the back burner and do n't think about it unless it hits me right in the face , '' Balon said . 
`` I am so full of anger still . '' 
AN OFFICER ALSO GRIEVES Almost every day , Rene Swanson thinks about what Mark Barton discovered at Barton 's apartment in Stockbridge . 
Still , Mark Barton 's voice breaks when Mark Barton talks about it . 
`` There are no words to describe it , '' said Swanson , a detective with Henry County police . 
`` When I went in there , it was the worst thing I would ever want to see . '' 
Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton 's children , 11-year-old Scott and 8-year-old Michelle , and their stepmother , Leigh Ann Barton . 
All three had been beaten to death with a hammer . 
Barton admitted to the crimes in a suicide note Edward left in the living room . 
Swanson said she ca n't come to terms with the ritualistic way Barton killed Scott 's children , then washed and combed their hair , dressed them in pajamas , tucked them into bed and surrounded them with their prized possessions . 
Leigh Ann Scott placed a Swiss army knife , Boy Scout patches and Pokemon trading cards ; beside Michelle , a doll with a pink dress and blond hair in pigtails . 
`` You could smell shampoo in their hair , '' Swanson said . 
`` In some sense , there had to be some kind of love there , too . '' with Bill Spivey , the children 's grandfather . 
Spivey believes his wife , Eloise , and Debra , Mark Barton 's daughter and Barton 's first wife , were murdered by Barton in 1993 , a case which remains unsolved . 
Spivey invited Swanson to lunch a few weeks after last year 's killings . 
This month , Mark Barton asked Swanson , her husband and their children to join Mark Barton 's family for a Fourth of July party . 
`` It was heartbreaking , '' said Swanson , who normally does n't socialize with people Mark Barton meets on Mark Barton 's job. `` if things were different , it would have been them playing in the pool . '' 
Spivey does n't like to talk about the killings . 
And Mark Barton avoids the cemetery where Mark Barton 's grandchildren , their mother and Mark Barton 's wife are buried alongside one another . 
Visiting the grave sites , Mark Barton said , is too painful . 
`` All of us have lost our loved ones , '' Spivey said . 
`` If we can put this behind us and go on and try to have a constructive life , we would all be better off . '' 
SEEKING PEACE Alyce Wenzel has tried to move on . 
But sometimes , just driving the car on an errand , Mark Barton bursts into tears , remembering Mark Barton 's son , Scott Webb . 
`` Scottie never had a chance to get married or have children , and Mark Barton loved children , '' Wenzel said . 
`` I 'll just have to learn to take it day by day . 
God does n't give you more than you can handle . 
I believe that , or there is n't anything . '' 
Nell Jones has tried to put the shootings behind her , too . 
She returned to day trading for a while , but only as a form of therapy . 
Being around others who had lived through the killings helped her regain control of her emotions . 
Now , though , she mostly stays at home , trying , she said , to filter out the `` background noise . '' 
She is haunted by visions of what she witnessed : `` These lovely , innocent people . . . murdered in cold blood . '' 
`` They were there , and they were gone , '' she said . 
`` If I had been killed , what would I have left behind ? 
What would I have left undone and unsaid ? 
And can I look around and do them now ? '' 
One victim especially occupies her thoughts : Vadewattee Muralidhara , over whose body Mark Barton stepped when Mark Barton emerged from a closet where Mark Barton hid during part of Barton 's shooting spree . 
Muralidhara 's husband is haunted , too . 
`` She was not keen on day trading , '' Kesturkoppal Muralidhara said . 
`` It was Scott who was interested . 
I forced her . '' 
He recently moved to a new house , hoping to leave behind happy memories that now seem so painful . 
But his wife 's clothes hang in his new closet . 
When he closes his eyes , he sees his wife in the dress she wore when she died . 
He sees her gazing at him from the passenger side of his car , undressing by the bed they shared for 22 years , cooking the evening meal . 
`` My children come home and sit around , '' he said. `` ` Daddy , where is the food ? ' 
` Look , ' I say , ` I can not cook . 
Let 's go out and eat . ' 
They want to sit down at a table and all eat together . 
We have not done that in almost a year now . 
Not one time . 
That happiness , I do n't think , will ever come back to me . '' 
A month ago , the Muralidhara family traveled to their native Trinidad for a Hindu ceremony . 
Thirty days before the anniversary of a death , Hindus believe , the soul ascends to heaven . 
So 11 months after Barton killed Mark Barton 's with a bullet to the head , Vadewattee Muralidhara 's ashes were scattered in the sea . 
Finally , her husband said , this would bring `` peace to her soul . ''
