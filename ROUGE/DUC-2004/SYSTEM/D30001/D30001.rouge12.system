A copy of the letter was obtained Thursday.
Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.
Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in the election, was left out of last week's deal.
The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
The two parties said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.
