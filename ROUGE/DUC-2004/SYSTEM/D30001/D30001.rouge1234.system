The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life.
Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially opened on Sep. 24.
The deal assures the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government.
