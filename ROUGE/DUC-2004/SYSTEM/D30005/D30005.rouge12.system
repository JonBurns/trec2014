Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is thought to be living in Afghanistan.
He has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and remains at large.
The report made clear that the organization was being run on a shoestring.
According to U.S. intelligence sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group.
He bought the Shifa plant in March.
All three have pleaded innocent.
