Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
He has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
It is not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to bin Laden.
According to U.S. intelligence sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist group.
He said the Americans were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that he had to take precautions.
He remains a fugitive.
