One rebel soldier was wounded in the stomach, he said.
The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised to overrun the rest of the town.
The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors.
On Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport.
The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, after troops from Angola and Zimbabwe came to Kabila's aid.
Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15 million people.
They still talk about Tutsis leading the rebellion.
