At least half a dozen other Islamic activists have been rounded up since the bombing, the sources said.
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.
An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
Although Hamas initially claimed responsibility through anonymous phone calls to the police for Friday's attack all sides now have agreed that it was Islamic Jihad that carried it out.
