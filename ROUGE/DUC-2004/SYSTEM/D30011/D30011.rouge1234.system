Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.
He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
Earlier this week, Anwar appeared in court with a black eye and bruises on his neck and arms.
Mahathir, who had heart bypass surgery in 1989, had groomed Anwar, 51, as his successor.
The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year rule.
In the realm of cyberspace, though, he's top dog.
