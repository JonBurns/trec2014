Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed.
At 70, Sharon remains one of the great polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life.
