The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords.
The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
Major pieces of equipment, including the controls for the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.
