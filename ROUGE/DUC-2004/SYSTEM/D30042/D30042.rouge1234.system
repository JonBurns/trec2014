Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects.
The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.
The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Earlier, Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United States and Britain.
