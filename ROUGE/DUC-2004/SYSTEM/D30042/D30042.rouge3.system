Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects.
The U.N. sanctions ban air travel in and out of the country but do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.
The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270 people.
