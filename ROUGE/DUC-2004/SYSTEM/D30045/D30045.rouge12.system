Times are tough in the oil patch.
Shares of Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, rose $7.625, or 9.7 percent, to $86.
I think it is far from that.
They were pushing the envelope, and when prices fell they had to cut back.
Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be worth about $70 billion.
It was up 4.6 percent for the week.
Q. That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.
I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year.
Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago.
They had talks with Amoco.
