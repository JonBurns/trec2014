The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992.
One prisoner was beaten to death and had a Muslim party badge nailed to his head, a witness claimed.
Others were set on fire, raped and forced to commit sexual acts with members of their own family.
Hazim Delic, a Muslim who served as Mucic's deputy, was found guilty of two murders and of raping two women as well as torturing other inmates.
Mucic smiled as he heard his sentence of seven years in prison read out.
