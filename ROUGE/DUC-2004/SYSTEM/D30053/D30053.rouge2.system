The Palestinians deny that.
Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.
But officials said Science Minister Silvan Shalom attacked him for being too generous to the Palestinians by agreeing to the Clinton visit next week to Gaza and the West Bank.
The meeting is an interim step, ahead of Monday's PNC session, and is stipulated by the Wye agreement.
Clinton said the United States shares Israel's concerns about security.
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
