A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.
She had said she would run again in 2000.
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported.
She was divorced and had one son, according to Who's Who in Russia.
Starovoitova, 52, tried to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical reasons.
Usually, that would be the end of the story.
No one was hurt.
