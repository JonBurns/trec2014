Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
Matthew Shepard was born in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his youth there.
Two men and two women have been charged in the case.
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
According to the FBI, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759 hate crimes recorded in 1996.
Shepard, his hands bound behind his back with a nylon cord and tied to a fence post, was lying on the ground, face up, unconscious.
Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at all.
And a war it is.
