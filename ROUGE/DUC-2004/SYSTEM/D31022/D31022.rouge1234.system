In 1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
No firemen.
