Still, he insists he has no major illnesses and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term.
However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
A respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.
Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.
On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed narrowly.
Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week.
It did not say what had caused them.
