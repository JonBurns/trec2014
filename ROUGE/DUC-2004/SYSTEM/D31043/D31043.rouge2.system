The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office.
But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the president to select a prime minister.
Lahoud, 62, a former commander of Lebanon's army, was propelled to power with widespread popular backing.
Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country.
He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
The government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials.
Eleven deputies were absent.
