He pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
Hariri, 53, virtually has had a free hand in running the country since he became premier six years ago under former President Elias Hrawi.
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.
The new president must be sworn in on Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office after a six-year term.

All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.
