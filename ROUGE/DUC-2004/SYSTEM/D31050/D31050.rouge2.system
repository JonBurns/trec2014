Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political party.
Liu was never put on trial.
Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.
Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their 11-year-old daughter, the family said.
