LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and dodging reviews from the Dark Side , the new `` Star Wars '' movie was set to open , appropriately , when the stars are out , at midnight screenings around the country early Wednesday . 
`` This is the best place to be right now in the whole world , '' said Chris Chaplin , 30 , who had a ticket to the midnight show at Mann 's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the doors swung open to get a good seat . 
It 's a foregone conclusion that `` Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace '' will be one of the biggest films of all time . 
The only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach the $ 600 million `` Titanic '' collected in North America . 
`` It 's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge , unprecedented business , '' said Paul Dergarabedian , president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co. 
`` But beyond that you 're in a very competitive release period . '' 
Best estimates are `` The Phantom Menace '' will reap more than $ 100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through Sunday , putting it on a pace to beat `` Lost World : Jurassic Park '' for the film-opener crown . 
`` Lost World '' made a record $ 90.2 million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997 . 
`` The Phantom Menace '' also will be competing against its ancestors . 
The original `` Star Wars '' is the No. 2 movie of all time . 
Counting its various re-issues , it has sold $ 461 million in tickets domestically . 
`` Return of the Jedi '' has grossed $ 309 million , for No. 7 on the all-time list , and `` The Empire Strikes Back '' has made $ 290 million , for ninth place . 
Because of the intense adoration for the first three `` Star Wars '' movies , the new installment is considered critic-proof . 
Which is a good thing for `` Star Wars '' creator George Lucas . 
The reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious . 
The harshest had to be The New Yorker 's Anthony Lane , who likened `` The Phantom Menace '' to excrement . 
More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times , who called it a `` considerable letdown , '' a `` ponderous and plodding '' movie that is `` noticeably lacking in warmth and humor . '' 
Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle . 
Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was `` an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking . '' 
Produced , directed and written by Lucas , who also bankrolled the entire $ 115 million-plus budget , `` The Phantom Menace '' begins the back story of `` Star Wars . '' 
It is set a generation earlier , when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker , who would grow up to become Luke 's absentee father . 
The merchandising campaign for `` The Phantom Menace '' is so far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons beyond recycling . 
Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead for a `` Star Wars '' chicken tie-in commercial . 
The first of the hard-core `` Star Wars '' fans started lining up weeks ago , and when advanced tickets became available last week , there was a buying frenzy , with the midnight shows selling out almost immediately . 
At Mann 's Chinese , where the original `` Star Wars '' premiered 22 years ago , more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning Tuesday . 
One was Analisa Siemsen , 21 , an aspiring screenwriter . 
`` I never camped out for anything before , '' she said , `` but there 's no Woodstock , so you have to come to the ` Star Wars ' line . ''
