WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used , and the government 's chief transportation safety official says few are . 
Jim Hall , chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board , asked states Monday to get moving on setting up `` fitting stations '' where parents go to have child restraints installed and checked . 
Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio , Hall offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving period of Labor Day holiday week . 
Several were driven by the knowledge that car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children . 
`` Safety advocates know that children should be in child restraints up to the age of 4 , in booster seats to the age of 8 , and in the back seat , '' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat belt . 
But `` not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with all of these requirements in it . '' 
Indeed , no state requires booster seats for children 4 to 8 , he said . 
In January , the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting stations . 
So far , two are doing so , New York and South Carolina . 
Three others -- Hawaii , Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites where motorists can get trained in using the seats , according to the board . 
Separately , DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in Minneapolis , Washington , D.C. , Denver and Sacramento , Calif. 
Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black youths , who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to use them . 
If seat belt use were universal among young blacks , that could save 1,300 lives a year , he said . 
He held out New Mexico 's graduated licensing law as a fitting model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an expected 22 percent by 2005 . 
The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate license , both restricting night driving and the number of young passengers allowed . 
A full license is granted only with a clean record . 
Hall praised DaimlerChrysler , but said `` states should n't wait for automakers to do something . '' 
`` They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment of permanent fitting stations '' -- perhaps at repair shops , firehouses , health centers or places where cars are annually inspected for safety , he said . 
So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money to help . 
About $ 90,000 is available for fitting station demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal year , said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
