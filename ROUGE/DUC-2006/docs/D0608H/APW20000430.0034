TRENTON , N.J. 
( AP ) -- Drivers who have spent the last 15 years ignoring the state 's seat belt law , listen up : The chance of getting hit with a $ 20 fine is growing . 
On Monday , police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts . 
Previously , officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts. '' We 're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey , '' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway , D-Burlington , a sponsor of the measure Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January. '' This is n't about punishment . '' 
Conaway , who is a doctor , said the change also will benefit children , who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents. '' By enforcing that requirement , we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up , but more importantly , the number of children will also go up , '' Conaway said . 
The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the state 's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state falls below the national average of 68 percent . 
Conaway said the council 's statistics show children are belted in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not . 
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat belts , Conaway said . 
The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of children killed in automobile accidents were n't wearing seat belts . 
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year. '' It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member that someone died because they were n't wearing a seat belt , '' Dr. Jennifer Wailer , a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt coalition , told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday 's editions. '' I can tell you it 's very tiring , because this is preventable . '' 
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change , arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999 . 
The current fine of $ 20 will remain unchanged and offenders will not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points .
