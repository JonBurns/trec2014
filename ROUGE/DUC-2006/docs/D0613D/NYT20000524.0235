It 's the day you 've either been dreading or , perhaps , secretly awaiting _ the day your baby graduates from high school and leaves home or maybe comes home again after college . 
But whether you 're weeping with joy or despair , the gift you give is a great way of showing your grad how well you understand his or her angst and ambitions . 
Youth Intelligence recently asked more than 1,000 high school and college seniors what they 'd like for graduation . 
Not surprisingly , the most common requests were for the newest technology , but there were still a few desired items that do n't need a manual . 
Here are some of the hottest gifts on the Gen-X hit list . 
PORTABLE DVD PLAYER The No. 1 requested gift ( other than cash ) was a portable DVD player . 
Portable DVD players run on batteries and can go anywhere . 
I 've even seen people in New York City walking down the street watching a movie . 
At a list price of approximately $ 1,000 , this is a costly purchase , but one I know your grad will love . 
DIGITAL CAMERA When it comes to capturing graduation memories , today 's seniors wo n't settle for old-fashioned photos . 
More than 65 percent of the respondents we surveyed wanted a digital camera . 
While most adults ca n't turn one on , the next generations can have a picture cropped , re-colored and e-mailed to their classmates before you say cheese . 
Plan to spend between $ 300 and $ 1,500 to make your grad happy . 
MOBILE PHONE Whether your grad is switching apartments , traveling or just avoiding the prying eyes of parents , Gen X considers the personal phone a necessity . 
Although Nokia ruled the roost with ther sleek , silver version , Motorola 's V series , just out a few months and priced at around $ 500 , is gaining steam . 
Hipsters in Los Angeles and New York carry them , and grads crave the streamlined size and Internet access . 
Before you buy any phone , make sure that your grad 's phone carrier can use it _ though if a particular model is a `` must have , '' your grad may prefer to switch carriers . 
SPORTY KICKS ( shoes , that is ) Air Prestos are the coolest shoes in town . 
When I recently wore a pair to a high school in Los Angeles , I was mobbed by teens who wanted them , and one offered me twice the retail price ( $ 85 ) . 
Nike is a trailblazer once again . 
These athletic shoes weigh almost nothing ( which makes them easy to pack ) but provide support and comfort ( which suits the adventurous athlete ) . 
It does n't hurt that they come in a dazzling array of colors . 
CHARM BRACELET You might have purchased one of these for your daughter on her fifth birthday and you 'd swear she misplaced it by her seventh . 
Chances are you 'll soon see it emerge from the depths of her dresser . 
Charm bracelets are back big time . 
Young people hunger for some of the things that previously brought them comfort . 
In addition , charms provide ultimate individualization . 
Each one tells a story . 
PERSONALIZED STATIONERY In a world of technology and gadgets , instant messaging and e-mails , young people are telling me that when it really counts , they 'd rather write a letter . 
Elaborate papers ( translucent , in unique shapes or with pressed flowers , ) help them feel that they 're sending something special . 
SUMMER STUFF Sooner or later your grad will head to the beach and this is a great way to buy a gift that is n't too expensive . 
Of course stylish sunners wo n't settle for plain old beach towels ( so pre-senior ) . 
Instead , they have their eyes on a beach mat . 
The most coveted are from a company called Inca ( I saw some hot versions at Fred Segal in Santa Monica a couple of weeks ago ) , which also have matching straw bags . 
When it comes to sunglasses , you ca n't go wrong with aviators . 
The coolest ones are from Stussy and Chloe , but XOXO offers a less expensive version . 
The hippest lenses are burgundy , but make sure they have strong UVA/UVB protection as often the tinted lenses do n't provide it . 
CYBER MONEY If you still do n't know what to get , let your grad decide . 
Buy some online money from CyberMoola.com , Flooze.com or Internetcash.com . 
Each of these sites has multiple online stores from which the recipient can choose. -0-Here Today/Coming TomorrowHere Today Malcolm in the Middle Self-tanners Jelly watch Coming Tomorrow M.Y.O.B Bronzers Gel candles -0- Jane Rinzler Buckingham is the president of Youth Intelligence , a market research firm specializing in the 7- to 35-year-old market .
