PROVIDENCE , R.I. 
( AP ) -- The remains of the first victims of EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified , four months after the plane plunged into the ocean . 
Medical , dental and fingerprint records were used to determine the identities of the 14 victims -- all U.S. residents -- paving the way for families to bury their relatives . 
The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket , killing the 217 people on board . 
A salvage ship worked for a week in December , raising the wreckage and remains off the ocean floor . 
The Rhode Island medical examiner 's office has been overseeing the identification process . 
It has been working with 6,000 tissue fragments and a smaller number of body parts . 
Only 1,300 fragments are suitable for DNA testing , and results may not be ready for 10 months . 
A memorial service was held in November in Newport for all the relatives and many already held private funerals . 
The National Transportation Safety Board estimated that 70 percent of the aircraft , including one engine , and sections of the wings , tail and body , was recovered . 
On Friday , NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would be raised . 
A civilian ship with an underwater robot is scheduled to begin the task March 18. '' They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures underwater , but it can also help if we have it out of the water to get a closer look at it , '' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said . 
After an examination of the flight data recorder , the cockpit voice recorder , radar data and small amounts of wreckage , Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash . 
Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately , saying his agency must conduct more studies before they settle on a cause .
