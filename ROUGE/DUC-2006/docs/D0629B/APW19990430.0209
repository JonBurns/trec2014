TAIPEI , Taiwan ( AP ) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software providers , police said today . 
But he admitted he did n't expect it to cause worldwide damage , a police statement said . 
Chen Ing-hau , 24 , looked nervous and was speechless when he was mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer meltdowns . 
The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH , for Chen 's initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers , the police statement said . 
Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of computer engineering at the Institute of Technology . 
Chen has since graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan 's mandatory two-year military service . 
Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when downloading video games and other software from the Internet , the police statement said . 
`` He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool of the software providers , from whom he had bought antivirus programs that proved useless , '' the statement said . 
`` He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact . 
He regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims . '' 
The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26 , the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to erase a computer 's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted . 
Under Taiwanese law , someone convicted of spreading computer viruses can face up to three years in prison . 
Police did not say whether Chen will be charged . 
Computer experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to spread the virus . 
But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking millions of dollars of damage compensation .
