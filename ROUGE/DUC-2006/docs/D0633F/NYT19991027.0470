Arrests by the New Jersey State Police were down 42 percent in September from the same period last year , and the head of the state troopers ' union said Wednesday that he attributed the decline to low morale and troopers ' fear of being accused of racial profiling . 
The statistics , which are published monthly , show a continuing trend of fewer arrests since February , when Col. Carl A. Williams , superintendent of the State Police , was forced to resign by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman . 
Williams had said in a newspaper interview at the time that certain racial and ethnic groups dominate segments of the illegal drug trade . 
In the month after the resignation , the number of arrests also fell 42 percent ; they had been up slightly the month before . 
Troopers made 1,042 arrests last month , 754 fewer than the 1,796 made in September 1998 , according to figures released Tuesday . 
The number of traffic summonses issued was also down , by about 10 percent , to 32,567 last month from 36,074 a year ago . 
Trooper Edward Lennon , president of the State Troopers Fraternal Organization , said the decline _ the largest since March _ reflected troopers ' poor morale and fears of being accused of singling out minority drivers . 
It was on Sept. 7 , Lennon said , that Troopers John Hogan , 29 , and James Kenna , 28 , were indicted on charges of attempted murder and assault in the April 1998 shooting of three unarmed men , two of them black and one Hispanic , on the New Jersey Turnpike . 
The incident led to widespread public criticism as well as state and federal investigations of the force . 
`` I think troopers are less likely to take the step further that is required to initiate a patrol-related arrest , '' Lennon said . 
`` When they stop a car for speeding , they 're issued a summons for speeding , and the driver 's on his way . '' 
There are indicators , like a driver 's nervousness , that might ordinarily prompt troopers to search a car , he said , but `` it could be that they are ignoring those indicators . '' 
John Hagerty , a spokesman for the State Police , would not comment on Lennon 's assertions . 
Hagerty said the decline could be linked to the reassignment of 40 troopers to flood relief duty last month or to a continuing decline in the overall crime rate . 
`` Let 's not forget that in 1998 we recorded a 9 percent drop in crime , and the FBI is telling us we 're looking at a similar decline in 1999 , '' he said . 
`` With declining crime rates , you 're going to have fewer arrests . '' 
Hagerty said troopers were also busier aiding drivers last month , with 15,127 reports of assistance , compared with 14,277 in September 1998 . 
The number of warnings issued fell slightly , to 15,418 from 15,684 . 
The State Police began publishing the monthly figures in April at the recommendation of Peter G. Verniero , then the state attorney general , to increase accountability and public confidence in the force . 
Hagerty said he could not say whether either goal had been achieved . 
`` State Police get letters , pro and con , on a daily basis , '' he said . 
`` Are we seeing a difference in the tone and nature of the letters ? 
Not necessarily . ''
