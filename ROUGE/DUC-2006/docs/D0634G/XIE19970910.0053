OTTAWA , September 9 ( Xinhua ) -- The Canadian province of British Columbia ( B.C . ) has launched its lawsuit against the United States for failing to curb overfishing by Alaska and other states in the Pacific Northwest . 
The Canadian province plans to seek 325 million dollars ( 230 million US dollars ) in damages for alleged U.S. overfishing , said reports today . 
" This is not about an attempt to get money for American overfishing , " B.C. Premier Glen Clark was quoted as saying . 
" This is about using the American court system to force the states to comply with the principles of salmon treaty , conserve the resource and force them to get back to the table and negotiate a treaty in both our interests . " 
The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty . 
The U.S. federal government signed the treaty in 1985 and remains responsible for enforcing it in individual states . 
Apart from the damages , the suit also seeks a court order certifying that the U.S. violated its international obligations , and directing Washington to compel compliance by individual states . 
The B.C. latest move reinvigorates the Pacific fish war that has raged between Canada and the U.S. for months . 
Yet , a memo leaked later Monday in Ottawa casts doubt on the province 's chance of success . 
The memo , prepared by Canada 's federal government , concludes that a U.S. court would not likely side with Canadian interests in such a dispute . 
Ottawa said it had considered its own lawsuit , but ruled out the option for various reasons including an interest in focusing on diplomacy .
