CHICAGO ( AP ) -- With the bank foreclosing on her landlord 's building , Magdalena Mendez needs to find an apartment for herself and her five children -- fast . 
But the Chicago salon assistant is having a hard time finding what she wants : a three-bedroom for less than $ 800 a month in the same neighborhood as her children 's schools . 
She 's not alone . 
A federal report released Monday shows that a record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million -- were paying more than half their income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997 , the freshest figures available . 
That 's an increase of 12 percent since 1991 . 
The report is being presented to Congress , which is considering a bill that includes $ 690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide. '' Everything is going so well ( economically ) , it 's hard to imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage , '' Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday. '' But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable housing . '' 
Housing and Urban Development officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest Americans . 
That , in turn , is driving up rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa. '' They want the city back , '' Mendez said of suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabilitated homes just blocks from the three-unit building she must leave Tuesday. '' It 's upsetting to those of us who 've always worked and lived here in the city -- who have an education , who work hard and who still ca n't get what we want , '' said Mendez , a 34-year-old Chicago native who paid $ 350 a month for her top-floor apartment in that building . 
She figures it could now rent for $ 1,000 a month if it 's rehabbed , and that 's more than she makes in a month . 
It 's not that gentrification is a new concept . 
But statistics show that it is an accelerating one . 
Consider San Francisco 's Mission District , a working-class , predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning upscale . 
In New York , old tenement buildings on Manhattan 's Lower East Side are being converted into luxury units . 
Federal researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units between 1993 and 1997 , compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993 . 
Officials at Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some neighborhoods are trying to buck. '' Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of America , and we 'd like to keep it that way , '' said Fran Tobin , a community activist who 's fighting to save affordable housing on Chicago 's far North Side. ------ On the Net : The HUD report can be found at : http : //www.hud.gov/news.html The Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies : http : //www.gsd.harvard.edu/jcenter/
