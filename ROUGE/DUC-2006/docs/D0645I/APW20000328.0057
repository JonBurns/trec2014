CHICAGO ( AP ) -- The economy may be booming , but a new federal report indicates not everyone is benefiting -- particularly the working poor who are having an increasingly hard time finding affordable housing . 
The report , issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , shows that a record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million of them -- were paying more than half their income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997 , the freshest figures available . 
That 's an increase of 12 percent since 1991 . 
Federal officials released the report to Congress , which is currently considering a bill that includes $ 690 million for 120,000 new rental assistance vouchers to be distributed in cities nationwide. '' Everything is going so well ( economically ) , it 's hard to imagine that we have such a terrible housing shortage , '' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo told reporters Monday. '' But actually the strong economy is one of the reasons we have a lack of affordable housing . '' 
HUD officials said incomes for average Americans are growing at a rate roughly 30 percent greater than incomes for the poorest Americans . 
That , in turn , is driving up rents and home prices from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago and Tampa. '' They want the city back , '' Magdalena Mendez said of suburbanites and others who are moving into pricey condominiums and rehabbed homes just blocks from the three-unit Chicago building she must vacate today . 
The bank is foreclosing on her landlord . 
So Mendez -- a 34-year-old salon assistant -- has been trying to find a three-bedroom apartment for herself and her five children for more than three months . 
She is having trouble finding anything for less than $ 800 per month in the same neighborhood as her children 's schools. '' It 's upsetting to those of us who 've always worked and lived here in the city -- who have an education , who work hard and who still ca n't get what we want , '' said Mendez , who paid $ 350 a month for her top-floor apartment that she figures could now rent for $ 1,000 a month if it 's rehabbed . 
That 's more than she makes in a month . 
It 's not that gentrification is a new concept . 
But statistics show that it is an accelerating one . 
Consider San Francisco 's Mission District , a working-class , predominately Hispanic neighborhood that is quickly turning upscale . 
In New York , old tenement buildings on Manhattan 's Lower East Side are being converted into luxury units . 
HUD researchers have found that the nation is losing low-income housing units at an increasingly alarming rate -- 400,000 units between 1993 and 1997 , compared with 425,000 between 1985 and 1993 . 
Officials at Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies also have noted the trend -- one that residents in some neighborhoods are trying to buck. '' Our community is kind of the example of the mix of all of America , and we 'd like to keep it that way , '' said Fran Tobin , a community activist who 's fighting to save affordable housing on Chicago 's North Side . 
But , he added , that is more easily said than done. '' The Daley administration has made it clear that their focus is middle and upper-class people , '' Tobin said , referring to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. '' I think that 's a pretty common attitude . '' 
Andrea Smith , a spokeswoman for Chicago 's Department of Housing , disputed that claim , pointing to a $ 4 million trust fund used to subsidize low-income renters and their landlords . 
But she noted that , like many cities nationwide , Chicago 's goal is to create mixed-income neighborhoods , rather than having large pockets of poverty. '' That 's what a healthy city needs , '' she said . 
In the meantime , Mendez 's ex-husband has taken custody of their children until she finds a suitable place for them to live . 
She plans to live with her two sisters while she seeks apartments and is almost to the point where she 'd take government help if it becomes available. '' I always thought I would n't need it . 
I do n't want to fall into the system or get trapped , '' said Mendez , who gets some rent help from her ex-husband. '' But I 'm not sure I have a choice anymore .
