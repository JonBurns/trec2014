IVANOVO , Russia ( AP ) -- For a candidate who insists he 's too busy being president to campaign , Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of time on the road , running one of the slickest election campaigns Russians have ever seen . 
Crisscrossing the vast country on trips described as official business , the acting president has reached out to interest groups , building support for the March 26 presidential election -- and giving himself an apparently unbeatable lead. '' People in the executive must prove their worth by their concrete deeds , not advertising , '' Putin told reporters , insisting that he was not campaigning on a visit this week to Ivanovo . 
It seems to be working with Russia 's disillusioned voters , who are tired of empty promises after a decade of democracy following the Soviet collapse . 
Putin 's image as a tough leader who can get things done goes down well with voters , even though he rarely offers specific policies. '' He 's a master of his word , who does n't give empty promises , '' said Lyuba Belova , 34 , a worker at the New Ivanovo weaving plant , which Putin visited. '' So what if he 's a former KGB man ? 
That means he 's a well-disciplined person , and discipline is what our country needs most of all . '' 
Putin 's 11 rivals seem almost invisible . 
The acting president has the support of about 60 percent of voters , with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent , opinion polls say . 
Apart from the daily TV accounts of Putin 's activities as president and his trips to the provinces , there are few signs that Russia is less than three weeks from a critical election . 
Putin has not accepted Zyuganov 's challenge to debate him and issues have barely surfaced . 
Unlike the 1996 election , when Boris Yeltsin defeated Zyuganov by dwelling on fears of a Communist comeback , few people take the Communists seriously anymore . 
Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31 and named Putin acting president , giving him a big edge at winning a full four-year term. '' Only elderly people nostalgic of the old times will vote for Zyuganov , '' said Yelena Rusova , another worker at the weaving plant . 
The candidates ' platforms are vague , with Putin and his rivals all pledging to ensure economic growth , improve miserable living standards , combat corruption and crime , and restore Russia as a great power . 
Zyuganov talks about rolling back market reforms and reviving Soviet-era economic controls . 
Putin says he will go on with market reform , while boosting state economic oversight to ensure everyone gets a fair break. '' The choice is n't between Putin and Zyuganov . 
It 's a question of to be or not to be for Russia , '' the Communist chief said recently , adding that Putin 's program '' is murderous for Russia . '' 
A group of economic experts , including reformers , has been working out an economic program for Putin , but it 's not clear when it will be unveiled. '' I think that it would be offered to the public even before the election , '' Putin said on a recent trip , then quickly added : '' Surely , before the election . '' 
Putin has focused on reaching out to the country 's various interest groups , such as local government officials , farm workers and factory crews , showing interest in the problems each segment faces . 
In Ivanovo , a major textile center 190 miles east of Moscow , Putin was targeting two groups at once -- industrial workers and women . 
So many women work in the city that it is known as '' The City of Brides . '' 
The visit coincided with International Women's Day on Wednesday -- a national holiday when women traditionally receive gifts and flowers . 
Putin spoke about reviving the textile industry , then complimented his mostly female audience. '' The official purpose of this trip is to attend an official meeting dedicated to prospects of light industries , but the real reason is to visit Ivanovo ... the women 's capital -- on the eve of March 8 , '' he said Tuesday as the hall burst into applause. '' We owe everything to women . '' 
But Putin prefers to address big official gatherings and rarely seems comfortable chatting with people , rarely going out to press the flesh . 
Not that the voters seem to mind. '' He has a lot of work to do , he has no time to lose , '' Belova said as Putin rushed through her workshop without stopping to talk to any of the admiring workers. ------ On the Net : The Russian Cabinet , including remarks by Putin , http : //www.pravitelstvo.gov.ru The Russian Communist Party , http : //www.kprf.ru The Reformist Yabloko party of candidate Grigory Yavlinsky , http : //www.yabloko.ru
