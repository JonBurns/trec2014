Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., represented the Keenans and has said Keenans intends to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment, including the sect's name. 
In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group. 
Keenan said that Richard Girnt Butler begged the men not to kill Richard Girnt Butler's son and that one of the guards then asked Richard Girnt Butler's if Richard Girnt Butler was Indian. 
Lawyer Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center who is representing Victoria Keenan and Victoria Keenan's son, Jason, introduced letters, photographs and depositions to contradict the men's testimony. 
Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a campaign to drive them out of business. 
Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago. 
Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan.
