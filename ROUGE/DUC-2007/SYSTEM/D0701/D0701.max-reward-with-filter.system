Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name. 
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and Richard Girnt Butler's son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages. 
Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago. 
His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and William Safire's second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a woman and Boggs Jr.'s son, both white, by the guards in July 1998. 
Dees, of the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations. 
Mostly, though, O'Connor talks about those rumors.
