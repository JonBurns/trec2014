The plaintiffs , Victoria Keenan , now 44 , and Richard Girnt Butler 's son , Jason , now 21 , who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998 , had asked the jury for nearly $ 12 million in compensatory and punitive damages . 
His suit contends that compound guards , the Aryan Nations , its 82-year-old founder , Richard Girnt Butler , and William Safire 's second in command , Michael Teague , should be held liable for an attack on a woman and Boggs Jr. 's son , both white , by the guards in July 1998 . 
Morris Dees , the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Ala. , and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs , said he intended to enforce the judgment , taking everything the Aryan Nations owns , including its trademark name . 
Richard Girnt Butler , the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound , and Richard Girnt Butler 's deputy , Michael Teague , were ordered to pay most of the $ 6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman , three-man jury . 
The case has its origins on July 1 , 1998 , when Victoria Keenan , 43 , and Morris Dees 's son Jason , 20 , were driving on a country road near Hayden Lake . 
In six such lawsuits , the Montgomery , Ala. , lawyer has never lost .
