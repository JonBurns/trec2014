Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name. 
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and Richard Girnt Butler's son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages. 
In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998. 
Dees, of the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations. 
Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and Richard Girnt Butler's deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury. 
In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column. 
The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.
