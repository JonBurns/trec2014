Morris Dees , the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Ala. , and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs , said he intended to enforce the judgment , taking everything the Aryan Nations owns , including its trademark name . 
In his suit here , Dees , a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center , seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son , both white , who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998 . 
The plaintiffs , Victoria Keenan , now 44 , and Richard Girnt Butler 's son , Jason , now 21 , who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998 , had asked the jury for nearly $ 12 million in compensatory and punitive damages . 
Dees , of the Montgomery , Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center , has said he hoped the penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations . 
His suit contends that compound guards , the Aryan Nations , its 82-year-old founder , Richard Girnt Butler , and William Safire 's second in command , Michael Teague , should be held liable for an attack on a woman and Boggs Jr. 's son , both white , by the guards in July 1998 . 
I directed him to Julian Bond , who was then president of the Southern Poverty Law Center . 
An understatement , for sure .
