For the last two decades , schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city 's museums , concert halls and theaters for lessons in art , music and dance . 
The school has a new series of courses on hydropower , electronics , architecture , building materials , electric appliances , tourism , computers , accounting , law , public relations , and practical English to meet the local economic and industrial development needs . 
After the construction of Inner City Arts , Maltzan designed a new arts complex , completed in March , at Harvard/Westlake School , a private , affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood . 
The Bingham Academy , in its third year , offers a five-week program for five disciplines : creative writing , dance , instrumental and vocal music , theater and visual arts . 
While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math , they have also increased the arts education budget by $ 150 million since 1997 , providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city 's 1,100 public schools . 
Last June , saying that without adequate funding , the arts ca n't flourish , the task force asked the city to establish a $ 200 million public endowment for the arts , raising roughly $ 15.5 million per year for 10 years , eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts Commission .
