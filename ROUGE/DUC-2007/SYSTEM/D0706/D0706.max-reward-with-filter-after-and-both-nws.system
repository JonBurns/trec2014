Suu Kyi is engaged in Aung San Suu Kyi's fourth confrontation in two months with the military government over Aung San Suu Kyi's right to travel freely within Myanmar, also known as Burma. 
He said there are 24 refugee camps along the Myanmar-Thai border where members and their families of different anti-Myanmar government armed groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic Front ( ABSDF ), Kayin National Union ( KNU ) and Democratic Alliance of Burma ( DAB ) are living and conducting military and " terrorist " training there involving foreigners. 
Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for Myanmar's peaceful struggle for democracy against the military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma. 
While Myanmar's military government continued its arrests of the country's democracy activists, a top general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday. 
The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of parliament and other members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party imprisoned since May. 
They should pressure Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi, Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately denied its right to govern by the military.
