The European Commission, the European Union ( EU )'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU. 
Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara. 
" Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14 members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the framework of customs union, " the statement said. 
Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union ( EU ), which confirmed the perspective of Turkey's full membership to the group. 
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here. 
Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished.

Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's efforts for EU membership, but the charge is rejected by Panglos.
