The European Commission, the European Union ( EU )'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU. 
But it will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing internal problem. 
" Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14 members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the framework of customs union, " the statement said. 
Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union ( EU ), which confirmed the perspective of Turkey's full membership to the group. 
" The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU, " he said, referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996. 
Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished. 
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here. 
He, however said that he understands Turkey's frustration over the EU decisions.
