A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said : " It is impossible for us to accept the contents and the reasons of the decision made by the European Parliament related to the scheduled aid to Turkey . " " Like its decision on September 19 , 1996 , the European Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation between Turkey and the European Union ( EU ) , " the statement said . 
The European Commission , the European Union ( EU ) 's executive arm , Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey 's ties with the EU . 
The European Parliament , angered by Turkey 's human rights record , voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU . 
Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union ( EU ) , which confirmed the perspective of Turkey 's full membership to the group . 
" The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey 's trade relations with the EU , " he said , referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996 . 
" The European Union , without renouncing its principles , " will have to decide in December to allow Turkey to become a formal candidate for EU membership . 
" Turkey is a European country , " State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters .
