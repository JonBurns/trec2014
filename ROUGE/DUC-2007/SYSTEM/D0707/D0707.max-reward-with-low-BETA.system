A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said : " It is impossible for us to accept the contents and the reasons of the decision made by the European Parliament related to the scheduled aid to Turkey . " " Like its decision on September 19 , 1996 , the European Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation between Turkey and the European Union ( EU ) , " the statement said . 
The European Commission , the European Union ( EU ) 's executive arm , Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey 's ties with the EU . 
But it will help smooth Turkey 's path into the European Union , and may permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict , Turkey 's most vexing internal problem . 
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey 's concern , Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by the Western European Union , the EU 's military body . 
Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about Turkey 's human rights record and its retention of the death penalty , which all members of the European Union have abolished . 
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of Turkey 's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for Turkey to take up a position , Turkey 's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here .
