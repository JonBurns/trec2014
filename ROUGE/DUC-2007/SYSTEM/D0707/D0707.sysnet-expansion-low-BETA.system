A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said : " It is impossible for us to accept the contents and the reasons of the decision made by the European Parliament related to the scheduled aid to Turkey. " " Like its decision on September 19, 1996, the European Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation between Turkey and the European Union ( EU ), " the statement said. 
Turkey is angry over the European Union ( EU ) decision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations. 
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU. 
Turkey tonight accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union aid to Turkey. 
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations. 
The U.S. government said today that the European Union ( EU ) should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.
