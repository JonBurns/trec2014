Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ), told the symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects, which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of water resources. 
The Addis Ababa Regional Water and Sewerage Authority announced that the shortage of potable water in the capital city of Ethiopia will be solved in the last quarter of this year. 
The prime minister was shocked to find that the water level at Ruvu River, the main source of water of the city, is " alarmingly low " when he inspected the Ruvu water works Wednesday. 
Petrides classified the measures to ease water shortage in three categories, namely the reduction of water supply, its better saving and the increase of water reserves available. 
It includes the construction of a water pipeline, a water purifying plant, and a water supply network in the urban district, and improvement of the Fangta Reservoir. 
However, Asmal assured that the Free State would not be deprived of its water resources if water is transferred from Orange River to the Vaal Dam, a major water supplier of Gauteng Province. 
" We must immediately put into action practical water conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and allows us to recycle water, " he said.
