Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency ( CNA ) reported Thursday. 
Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday. 
A Cypriot police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974. 
Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, which has close relations with Israel but not with Cyprus. 
" Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus, " Tzur said. 
Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. 
The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday. 
The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of Larnaca.
