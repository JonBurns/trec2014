Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents , Cyprus News Agency ( CNA ) reported Thursday . 
Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad , an Israeli newspaper said Thursday . 
" Israel is a close friend of Cyprus , Israel wo n't harm Cyprus , there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus , " Tzur said . 
A Cypriot police source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey , which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 . 
Police officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey , which has close relations with Israel but not with Cyprus . 
There were no other details . 
Suspects Udi Hargov , 37 , and Igal Damary , 49 , have been remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia for further investigation at an unspecified location , reports from Cyprus said , adding that the two are being held separately . 
Earlier this week , the Israeli Foreign Ministry would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey , Israel 's military ally , were not true .
