Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency ( CNA ) reported Thursday. 
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman departure from Nicosia during Glafcos first visit to the island country in 1998. 
Haaretz A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel would do everything it could to bring about the repatriation of the two Mossad agents who were sentenced to three years in prison in Cyprus. 
" Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus, " Tzur said. 
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port of Ziyi. 
The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions, and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a mission. 
Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel. 
Israel government has not acknowledged that the two are Israeli agents.
