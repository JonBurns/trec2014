Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.

" Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus, " Tzur said. 
A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu office Wednesday regarding two Israelis accused of spying in Cyprus was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel Mossad. 
Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel. 
The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests. 
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port of Ziyi.
