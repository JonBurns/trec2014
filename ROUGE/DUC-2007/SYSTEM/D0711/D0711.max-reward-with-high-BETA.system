The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week , giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft 's proposal , filed Wednesday , to revise the government 's break up plan . 
Caldera Systems Inc. , an Orem , Utah , maker of Linux software , filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996 . 
If government officials had concluded that the proposal was , in their view , serious and comprehensive , they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case , Richard A. Posner , chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals there . 
The government , of course , had recognized that IBM 's size , reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft 's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions . 
The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp. , which received a significantly lower price , Microsoft says , because it shared in the costs of developing a straightforward business rationale for different terms , says Microsoft , not punishment meted out by a monopolist . 
Klein 's comments notwithstanding , the Justice Department 's lead lawyer in the Microsoft case , David Boies , is one of the most highly regarded litigators in the country . 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling that , as expected , the company would appeal .
