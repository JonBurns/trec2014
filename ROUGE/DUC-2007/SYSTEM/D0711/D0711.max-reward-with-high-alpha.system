The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan. 
Caldera Systems Inc., an Orem, Utah, maker of Linux software, filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996. 
At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company. 
Netscape Communication Corp., Microsoft's major rival in the U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software. 
The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions. 
If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals there. 
Instead, Microsoft might well have violated the law. 
It declined comment Wednesday.
