He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
India has long spurned both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to give up their nuclear arsenals. 
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998. 
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week. 
" Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have fumbled because of India's negativism, " he added. 
" We conducted nuclear tests on May 28 and 30 to convey the message to the world that Pakistan has become a nuclear power, " Qadeer said. 
Nor was Pakistan the first to conduct nuclear explosive tests, " the statement said.
