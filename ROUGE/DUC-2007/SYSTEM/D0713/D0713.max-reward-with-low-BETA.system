He said China , as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty , has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation . 
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan 's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar , the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998 . 
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday , " We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . " 
Several governments , including the United States , Japan and the European Union , urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
" Our many proposals , including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia , have fumbled because of India 's negativism , " he added . 
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , urging all nations to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear facilities to international inspection .
