He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
India has long spurned both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to give up their nuclear arsenals. 
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998. 
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday, " We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. " 
" Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have fumbled because of India's negativism, " he added. 
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week. 
Our compulsions are not hidden.
