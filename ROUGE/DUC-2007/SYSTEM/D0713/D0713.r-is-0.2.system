Russia on Thursday repeated its call to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ). 
He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them discriminatory. 
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan  Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998. 
The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear facilities to international inspection. 
More countries have come out to condemn Pakistan  nuclear tests. 
Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ). 
Pakistan responded with its own tests.
