Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement. 
Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy. 
Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users. 
Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America. 
Either way, and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy. the heavy metal and rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against Napster for copyright infringement. 
From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
