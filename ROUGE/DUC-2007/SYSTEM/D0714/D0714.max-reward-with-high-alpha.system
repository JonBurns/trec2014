Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement. 
Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy. 
Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users. 
Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America. 
Another subplot features Napster's singer-rapper, Fred Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records, whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate lawsuit against Napster. 
Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do. 
Napster doesn't do anything.
