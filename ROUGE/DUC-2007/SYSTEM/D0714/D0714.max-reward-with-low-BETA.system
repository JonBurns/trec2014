Napster 's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists , but the recording industry and two artists , Metallica and Dr. Dre , sued Napster , claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy . 
Napster , a company in San Mateo , Calif. , that operates an online service , has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies , the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre , who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement . 
Hank Barry , the chief executive of Napster , based in San Mateo , Calif. , said the company 's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users . 
The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc. , the Sony Corp. , Bertelsmann and other record companies , represented by the recording association , sued the service for copyright infringement . 
Metallica , which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San Mateo , Calif. , startup , wants Napster to block further access to all of the users on the 60,000-page list , a request Napster says it might honor . 
Hilary Rosen , president of the Recording Industry Association of America , drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella , which pay no royalties , and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City , which do . 
Napster does n't do anything .
