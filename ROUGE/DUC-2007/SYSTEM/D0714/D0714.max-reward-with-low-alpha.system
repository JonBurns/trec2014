Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement. 
Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica and Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy. 
Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users. 
Either way, and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy. the heavy metal and rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against Napster for copyright infringement. 
Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music sharing software. 
The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales. 
And Lars Ulrich said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry.
