Napster 's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists , but the recording industry and two artists , Metallica and Dr. Dre , sued Napster , claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy . 
Napster , a company in San Mateo , Calif. , that operates an online service , has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies , the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre , who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement . 
Until last week , when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement , the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies ' trade group , the Recording Industry Association of America . 
The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc. , the Sony Corp. , Bertelsmann and other record companies , represented by the recording association , sued the service for copyright infringement . 
Hank Barry , the chief executive of Napster , based in San Mateo , Calif. , said the company 's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users . 
Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school , two other universities and California-based Napster , which makes the popular Internet music sharing software . 
And Lars Ulrich said that Napster was helping , not hurting the recording industry .
