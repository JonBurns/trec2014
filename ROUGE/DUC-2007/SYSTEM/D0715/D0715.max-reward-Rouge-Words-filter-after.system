Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced. 
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries. 
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force. 
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days. 
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed. 
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty. 
France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N. officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. 
The National Assembly ratified the treaty on Wednesday.
