Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday , meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months , the United Nations announced . 
More than 120 countries signed the treaty , known as the Ottawa Convention , in the Canadian capital in December , but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect . 
The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty , maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea . 
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty . 
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use , production and stockpiling , anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days . 
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) to join the mine ban treaty , report reached here said on Friday . 
In a survey completed last April , the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines , which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize , reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed , though before it officially went into force .
