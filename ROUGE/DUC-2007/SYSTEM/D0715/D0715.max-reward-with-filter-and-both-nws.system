Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced. 
The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty, maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea. 
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days. 
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty. 
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) to join the mine ban treaty, report reached here said on Friday. 
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force. 
It has been two years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly negotiated in Oslo.
