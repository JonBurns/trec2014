The treaty , negotiated and adopted in Oslo , Norway , in September , bans the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines . 
More than 120 countries signed the treaty , known as the Ottawa Convention , in the Canadian capital in December , but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect . 
Last December , the International Campaign to Ban Landmines , and its American coordinator , Jody Williams , won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year . 
Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty itself. the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on went into effect March 1 , 1999 , six months after the 40th nation ratified it , but it has little force . 
Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday , meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months , the United Nations announced . 
What 's more , despite the campaign 's publicity , several major countries still refuse to adopt the treaty , including the United States , Russia and China , mostof the nations in the Middle East and many in Asia . 
It prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transferring of anti-personnel land mines .
