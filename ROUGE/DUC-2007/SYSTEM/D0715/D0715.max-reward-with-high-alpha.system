The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. 
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect. 
Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year. 
Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced. 
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries. 
A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are expected to sign the treaty. 
What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United States, Russia and China, mostof the nations in the Middle East and many in Asia. 
Guerrillas also planted mines.
