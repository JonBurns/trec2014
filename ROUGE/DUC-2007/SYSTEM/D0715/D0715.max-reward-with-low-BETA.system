More than 120 countries signed the treaty , known as the Ottawa Convention , in the Canadian capital in December , but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect . 
The treaty , negotiated and adopted in Oslo , Norway , in September , bans the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines . 
In a survey completed last April , the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines , which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize , reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed , though before it officially went into force . 
Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday , meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months , the United Nations announced . 
Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty itself. the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on went into effect March 1 , 1999 , six months after the 40th nation ratified it , but it has little force . 
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines , it said they have found , in Angola , about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries . 
Neither Israel nor Lebanon has signed the treaty .
