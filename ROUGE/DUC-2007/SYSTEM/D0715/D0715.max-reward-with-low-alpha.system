The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. 
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect. 
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force. 
Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced. 
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries. 
Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year. 
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries, 74 of which have ratified it.
