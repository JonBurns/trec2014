Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park. 
The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine. 
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites. 
A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values. 
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered. 
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list. 
Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's reputation.
