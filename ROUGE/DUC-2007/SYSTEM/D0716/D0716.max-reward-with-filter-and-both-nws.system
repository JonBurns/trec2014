Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park. 
" The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger, " the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu ( National Park in Northern Territory ) was under threat from Jabiluka. 
The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday. 
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory. 
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites. 
The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
