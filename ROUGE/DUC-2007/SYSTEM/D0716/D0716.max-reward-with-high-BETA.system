The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park , which is on the World Heritage List , in northern Australia 's Northern Territory . 
Australia 's conservative government defied a U.N. body 's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park . 
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka , a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park , listed by the United Nations Education , Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites . 
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto , Japan , granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park , which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine , endangered . 
" The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger , " the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu ( National Park in Northern Territory ) was under threat from Jabiluka . 
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee 's endangered list .
