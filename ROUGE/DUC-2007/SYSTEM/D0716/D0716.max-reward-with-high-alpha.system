The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory. 
The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday. 
The Australian : The Australian government's environmental report on the Jabiluka uranium mine ( located in Kakadu Natural Park ), to be released Thursday, found the area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
