Australia 's conservative government defied a U.N. body 's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park . 
" The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger , " the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu ( National Park in Northern Territory ) was under threat from Jabiluka . 
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park , which is on the World Heritage List , in northern Australia 's Northern Territory . 
The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country 's vast Kakadu National Park , which is on the World Heritage List , after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday . 
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto , Japan , granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park , which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine , endangered . 
Located in the Northern Territory , northwest Australia , the Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km . 
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year .
