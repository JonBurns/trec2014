The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday. 
The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine. 
The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine. 
ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its Jabiluka lease within the park boundaries, near a uranium mine it already operates inside the park. 
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites. 
Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday. 
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
