American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today. 
In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement. 
American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the " fen " in fen-phen. 
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.

American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9 million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston Chronicle reported today. 
American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
American Home Products marketed Pondimin and Redux until September 1997. 
About six million people took the drug combination.
