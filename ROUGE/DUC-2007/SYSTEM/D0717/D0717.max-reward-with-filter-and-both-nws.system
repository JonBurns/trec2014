American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today. 
In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement. 
Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home Products Corp., a lawyer confirmed today. 
American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the " fen " in fen-phen. 
American Home Products Corp. agreed late Tuesday to pay $350 million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert. 
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. 
American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
American Home Products marketed fenfluramine and its chemical cousin dexfenfluramine until September 1997, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed for the drugs' withdrawal. 
American Home denies any wrongdoing.
