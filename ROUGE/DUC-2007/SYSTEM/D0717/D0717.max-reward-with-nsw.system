Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer , American Home Products Corp. , a lawyer confirmed today . 
In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen , drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug 's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement . 
American Home , through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary , half of the fen-and Redux , a similar product . 
During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton , Texas , on Wednesday , attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage .
