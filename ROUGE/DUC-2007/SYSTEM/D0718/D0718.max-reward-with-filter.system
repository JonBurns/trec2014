Like some of its customers, Starbucks investors are skeptical as well about the company's plans, announced late Wednesday, to become an Internet retailer, not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs, but of everything from frying pans to towels, picture frames and even sofas and credenzas. 
The company opened in New York in January 1999, followed by Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, D.C. 
STARBUCKS Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million.

Surprisingly, several sources named Starbucks Corp., the Seattle coffee giant, as the likely suitor. 
The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee shops is falling.
