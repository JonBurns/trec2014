Kozmo , which operates only in Boston , New York , Washington , Seattle and San Francisco so far , specializes in delivering videos , books , food and convenience goods . 
Like some of its customers , Starbucks investors are skeptical as well about the company 's plans , announced late Wednesday , to become an Internet retailer , not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs , but of everything from frying pans to towels , picture frames and even sofas and credenzas . 
STARBUCKS Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music , an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco , for under $ 10 million . 
Pasqua , which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks banner , operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area , Los Angeles and New York , and has eight licensed airport locations in California . 
Instead , Seattle 's Starbucks , a brick-and-mortar retailer , proposed buying Williams-Sonoma , a brick-and-an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on Williams-Sonoma 's e-commerce business . 
The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks , Howard Schultz , who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need more fancy coffee shops , promised to do the same with Internet strategy , with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks into cyberspace . 
The New York-based Kozmo delivers movies , books , magazines , CDs , video games , and food .
