STARBUCKS Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million. 
The New York Times Co. and Starbucks Coffee Co. said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times ' advertising promotion of Starbucks. 
Schultz Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. and Johnson Los Angeles-based Johnson Development Corp. have recently opened similar Starbucks coffee stores in West Los Angeles and New York Harlem. 
Most of it has been joint ventures : the ice cream with Dreyer Grand Ice Cream ; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola ; and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft Foods Inc. 
The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need more fancy coffee shops, promised to do the same with Internet strategy, with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks into cyberspace.
