France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday. 
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems. 
The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc ( 84 million U.S. dollars ) unemployment aid package. 
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates. 
Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country. 
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population are without jobs. 
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation, with " rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival. "
