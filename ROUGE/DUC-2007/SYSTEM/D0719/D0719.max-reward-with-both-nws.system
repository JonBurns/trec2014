Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent , reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France 's high jobless rate , long one of the nation 's knottiest problems . 
France 's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year , reducing the nation 's jobless people to 2,583,600 , said the Ministry of Employment Friday . 
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France , the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France 's social protection system , in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates . 
The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people , including sending an additional 500 million franc ( 84 million U.S. dollars ) unemployment aid package . 
Although France 's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months , jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country . 
France 's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5 percent in November , but nearly 3 million people remain without a job , the Labor Ministry said Friday . 
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation , with " rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival . "
