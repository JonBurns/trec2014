Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems. 
France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday. 
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates. 
The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc ( 84 million U.S. dollars ) unemployment aid package. 
This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment. 
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation, with " rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival. " 
Moreover, the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent, or 333,600 people, from December 1998 to December 1999. 
This is also the first time for the unemployment rate in France to be below 12.5 percent since September 1996.
