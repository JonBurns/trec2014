Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems. 
France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday. 
It is today, I know, with unemployment, your primary worry, " he said. 
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment. 
The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the G-7 summit, which drew here leaders from France, the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan. 
This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment. 
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population are without jobs. 
The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the " substantial structural impediments in the functioning of labor markets " of the country.
