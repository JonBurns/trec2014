Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent , reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France 's high jobless rate , long one of the nation 's knottiest problems . 
France 's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year , reducing the nation 's jobless people to 2,583,600 , said the Ministry of Employment Friday . 
But it predicted that France 's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment , while the measures taken in recent years , in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor , should reduce structural unemployment . 
Moreover , the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent , or 333,600 people , from December 1998 to December 1999 . 
The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the G-7 summit , which drew here leaders from France , the United States , Canada , Britain , Germany , Italy and Japan .

The unemployment rate in France now stands at 11.2 percent , with 2,770,400 people in the labor force in search for a job .
