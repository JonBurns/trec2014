Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent , reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France 's high jobless rate , long one of the nation 's knottiest problems . 
France 's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year , reducing the nation 's jobless people to 2,583,600 , said the Ministry of Employment Friday . 
Moreover , the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent , or 333,600 people , from December 1998 to December 1999 . 
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France , the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France 's social protection system , in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates . 
But it predicted that France 's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment , while the measures taken in recent years , in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor , should reduce structural unemployment . 
France 's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5 percent in November , but nearly 3 million people remain without a job , the Labor Ministry said Friday . 
The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people , including sending an additional 500 million franc ( 84 million U.S. dollars ) unemployment aid package . 
It is today , I know , with unemployment , your primary worry , " he said .
