France  unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation  jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday. 
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France  high jobless rate, long one of the nation  knottiest problems. 
The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc ( 84 million U.S. dollars ) unemployment aid package. 
France  unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which means that 3,114,600 people among France  working age population are without jobs. 
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France  social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates. 
This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment. 
Unemployment is one of France  worst economic problems, with joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed to a rise in crime and violence. 
Although France  unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
