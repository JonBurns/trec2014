Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year. 
A senior Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians. 
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. 
When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the " land for peace " principle by " peace with security " since Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996. 
Covenant also warned that Israel will scuttle the Oslo accords if Arafat declares independence.
