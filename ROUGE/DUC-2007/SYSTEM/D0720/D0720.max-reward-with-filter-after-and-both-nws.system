The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Netanyahu, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of " land-for-peace. " 
A senior Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. 
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians. 
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. 
Israel has to transfer the remaining West Bank territories except some military zones and Jewish settlements to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.
