The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Netanyahu, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of " land-for-peace. " 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year. 
A senior Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords. 
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. 
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. 
" Four years ago peace was born in Oslo.
