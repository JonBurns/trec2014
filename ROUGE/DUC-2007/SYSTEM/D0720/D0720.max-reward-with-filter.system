Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. 
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community. 
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date. 
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment.
