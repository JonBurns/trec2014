The Oslo Accords , signed by his predecessor , late Netanyahu , and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of " land-for-peace . " 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year . 
Upon his arrival from Cairo , Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords , Jerusalem is part of the occupied land , and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements . 
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah , West Bank , to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war , Arafat renewed Yasser Arafat 's pledge that Yasser Arafat would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process , even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel . 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns , has replaced the " land for peace " principle by " peace with security " since Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996 . 
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles , Yasser Arafat has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date . 
That 's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago , they said .
