The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Netanyahu, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of " land-for-peace. " 
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. 
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the " land for peace " principle by " peace with security " since Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996. 
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords. 
That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago, they said.
