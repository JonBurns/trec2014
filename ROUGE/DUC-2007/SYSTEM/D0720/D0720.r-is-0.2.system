A senior Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. 
When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections. 
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment. 
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, Yasser Arafat has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date. 
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community. 
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. 
Five years later, the rosy picture remains a dream.
