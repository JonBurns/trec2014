A senior Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward. 
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. 
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. 
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Netanyahu, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of " land-for-peace. " 
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, Yasser Arafat has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date. 
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the " land for peace " principle by " peace with security " since Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996. 
The council has 124 members.
