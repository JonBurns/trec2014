On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo. 
McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death last year. 
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck ; and the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence. 
Matthew Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains. 
Prosecutors say McKinney and Matthew Shepard, 22, posed as homosexuals, lured Shepard out of a downtown bar, drove him to a remote fence, tied him to it and pistol-whipped him into a coma. 
Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed his head. 
If convicted, Aaron McKinney faces the death penalty.
