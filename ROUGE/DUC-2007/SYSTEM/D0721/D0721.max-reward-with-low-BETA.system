On Oct. 6 , 1998 , Aaron McKinney , 21 , and Russell Henderson , 22 , lured Shepard , 21 , out of a bar , robbed him , beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie , Wyo. 
McKinney , 22 , is charged with first-degree murder , kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard 's death last year . 
Matthew Shepard 's mother , Judy , dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney 's father , William , bowed his head . 
Prosecutors say McKinney and Matthew Shepard , 22 , posed as homosexuals , lured Shepard out of a downtown bar , drove him to a remote fence , tied him to it and pistol-whipped him into a coma . 
But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation , the play reflects a community still in conflict : Romaine Patterson , a university student , says Matt Galloway was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights , yet a Baptist minister , who goes unnamed in the play , says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence , Shepard had a moment to reflect on Shepard 's lifestyle . 
Matthew Shepard , 22 , is serving two life sentences after pleading guilty to murder and kidnapping .
