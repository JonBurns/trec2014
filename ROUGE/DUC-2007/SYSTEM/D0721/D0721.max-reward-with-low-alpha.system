On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo. 
McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death last year. 
As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts all because Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay. 
But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play reflects a community still in conflict : Romaine Patterson, a university student, says Matt Galloway was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, Shepard had a moment to reflect on Shepard's lifestyle. 
Matthew Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San Francisco.
