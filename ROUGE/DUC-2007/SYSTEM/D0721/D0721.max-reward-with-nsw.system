On Oct. 6 , 1998 , Aaron McKinney , 21 , and Russell Henderson , 22 , lured Shepard , 21 , out of a bar , robbed him , beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie , Wyo. 
McKinney , 22 , is charged with first-degree murder , kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard 's death last year . 
Matthew Shepard 's mother , Judy , dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney 's father , William , bowed his head . 
The other suspect , Matthew Shepard , 22 , pleaded guilty in April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life sentences . 
Defense attorneys countered that McKinney , who faces the death penalty , did n't intend to kill Shepard when Matthew Shepard and a friend accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after Matthew Shepard asked McKinney for a ride home . 
McKinney 's co-defendant , Matthew Shepard , pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison . 
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney , 22 , for killing Matthew Shepard , a 21-year-old college student , but later Matthew Shepard 's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection . 
A jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder , kidnapping and robbery in the case , and Aaron McKinney could face the death penalty .
