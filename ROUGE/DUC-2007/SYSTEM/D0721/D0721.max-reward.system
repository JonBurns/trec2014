On Oct. 6 , 1998 , Aaron McKinney , 21 , and Russell Henderson , 22 , lured Shepard , 21 , out of a bar , robbed him , beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie , Wyo. 
McKinney , 22 , is charged with first-degree murder , kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard 's death last year . 
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper , Texas , of James Byrd , a 49-year-old black man , who was dragged behind a pickup truck ; and the death , also in 1998 , of Matthew Shepard , a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student , who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence . 
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney , 22 , for killing Matthew Shepard , a 21-year-old college student , but later Matthew Shepard 's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection . 
Matthew Shepard 's mother , Judy , dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney 's father , William , bowed his head . 
Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct. 6 , 1998 , from the Fireside Lounge , where McKinney and Russell Henderson encountered Shepard , to the beatings , which began as the two drove Matthew Shepard around town and continued at the fence . 
No , that 's ridiculous .
