Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket. 
Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday. 
The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense ( BMD ) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today. 
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. 
No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it can not be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores. 
Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
