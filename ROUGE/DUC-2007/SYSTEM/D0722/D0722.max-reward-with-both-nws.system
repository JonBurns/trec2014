Since Congress passed that bill in May , two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed , for the first time , to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures , a $ 3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , shooting down an incoming test rocket . 
Iran 's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system , Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday . 
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained a national missile defense program , expressing concern that it could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia . 
The Clinton administration has n't decided to deploy a national missile defense system , partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow . 
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) failed to intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White Sands Missile Range , New Mexico . 
President Bill Clinton has said that Bill Clinton favors a national missile defense but does not believe that the system should be deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote . 
But for the present , national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option .
