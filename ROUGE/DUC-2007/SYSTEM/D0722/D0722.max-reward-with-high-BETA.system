Since Congress passed that bill in May , two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed , for the first time , to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures , a $ 3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , shooting down an incoming test rocket . 
Tuesday 's test , postponed two weeks ago when a target missile went out of control , will be conducted over White Sands , New Mexico State , missile test range , Pentagon officials said . 
Revised estimates of nuclear missile capability , particularly of North Korea and Iran , add new urgency to development of a national missile defense system , the Clinton administration 's top arms-control official said . 
Iran 's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system , Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday . 
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , the United States and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense system . 
A land-based national missile defense system , under study by Henry Cooper Jr. administration , would cost an estimated $ 10.5 billion to build and , if approved , would n't be deployed until 2005 .
