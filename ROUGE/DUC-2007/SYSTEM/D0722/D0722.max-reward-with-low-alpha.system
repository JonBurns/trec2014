Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket. 
Tuesday's test, postponed two weeks ago when a target missile went out of control, will be conducted over White Sands, New Mexico State, missile test range, Pentagon officials said. 
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age " National Missile Defense " ( NMD ) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack. 
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. 
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
