Since Congress passed that bill in May , two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed , for the first time , to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures , a $ 3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , shooting down an incoming test rocket . 
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract , Boeing will design , develop , test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age " National Missile Defense " ( NMD ) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack . 
It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile failed to intercept the target missile Monday morning , said Bob Hunt , spokesman for the Army program executive office for air and missile defense in Huntsville , Alabama State . 
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor , Lockheed Martin , to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded , rather than the prototype used thus far , said Peter Franklin , deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization . 
However , the study says that the Pentagon should not deploy a national missile defense system until 2008 .
