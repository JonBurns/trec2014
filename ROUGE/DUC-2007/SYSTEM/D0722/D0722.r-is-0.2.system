Iran  weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday. 
The U.S. Congress has insisted that the United States should develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003. 
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. 
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense system. 
The Pentagon  fifth missile defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the Defense Department said in a statement. 
The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense ( BMD ) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today. 
Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front : -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. -- After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
