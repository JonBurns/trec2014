Feinstein won Feinstein's election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when Dianne Feinstein resigned Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat to become governor. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming election as a result of Republicans scuttling Dianne Feinstein's party's proposals to boost patients' rights. 
Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at Dianne Feinstein's level, must now gird for another tough contest, Dianne Feinstein's fourth statewide battle of the decade. 
Two years ago, Feinstein gave Feinstein's seat on the committee to Sen. Barbara Boxer as a way to help Feinstein's fellow California Democrat's chances for re-tens of millions of dollars for California projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San Francisco Bay. 
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said Feinstein's been so excited since Feinstein arrived in Los Angeles that Feinstein lost Feinstein's voice. 
Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California has gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing that one third of state voters still don't recognize Dianne Feinstein's name. 
The only reason Feinstein would accept No. 2 is so Dianne Feinstein might someday be No. 1, Dianne Feinstein's loyalists say.
