Feinstein won Feinstein's election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when Dianne Feinstein resigned Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat to become governor. 
Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of Dianne Feinstein's would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for Dianne Feinstein's party's own nomination. 
Two years ago, Feinstein gave Feinstein's seat on the committee to Sen. Barbara Boxer as a way to help Feinstein's fellow California Democrat's chances for re-tens of millions of dollars for California projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San Francisco Bay. 
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said Feinstein's been so excited since Feinstein arrived in Los Angeles that Feinstein lost Feinstein's voice. 
Feinstein also has in place a veteran team of campaign advisers, many of whom have been with Feinstein's through all Feinstein's campaigns of the past decade. 
Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California has gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing that one third of state voters still don't recognize Dianne Feinstein's name. 
This was Sen. Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the president's address on Aug. 17. 
It's not just the president.
