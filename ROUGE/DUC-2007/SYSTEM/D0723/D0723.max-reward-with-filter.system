Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of Dianne Feinstein's would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for Dianne Feinstein's party's own nomination. 
Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at Dianne Feinstein's level, must now gird for another tough contest, Dianne Feinstein's fourth statewide battle of the decade. 
Feinstein told reporters that Dianne Feinstein is focused on the issues Dianne Feinstein believes will form the core of Dianne Feinstein's re-election bid : Improving health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns, eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together opposing sides in California's long-running water wars. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming election as a result of Republicans scuttling Dianne Feinstein's party's proposals to boost patients' rights. 
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said Feinstein's been so excited since Feinstein arrived in Los Angeles that Feinstein lost Feinstein's voice. 
Feinstein's California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also said Thursday that Clinton would vote to acquit Clinton. 
Feinstein, D-Calif., has issued no public statement since. 
Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is over.
