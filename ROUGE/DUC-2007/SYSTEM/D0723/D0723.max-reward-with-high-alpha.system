Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of Dianne Feinstein's would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for Dianne Feinstein's party's own nomination. 
Feinstein won Feinstein's election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when Dianne Feinstein resigned Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat to become governor. 
Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at Dianne Feinstein's level, must now gird for another tough contest, Dianne Feinstein's fourth statewide battle of the decade. 
Feinstein told reporters that Dianne Feinstein is focused on the issues Dianne Feinstein believes will form the core of Dianne Feinstein's re-election bid : Improving health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns, eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together opposing sides in California's long-running water wars. 
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said Feinstein's been so excited since Feinstein arrived in Los Angeles that Feinstein lost Feinstein's voice. 
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about Dianne Feinstein's plans for re-election to the Senate. 
Feinstein devoted part of Dianne Feinstein's floor speech to the push for censure.
