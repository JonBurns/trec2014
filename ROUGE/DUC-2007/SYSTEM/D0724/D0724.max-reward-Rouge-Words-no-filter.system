Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday. 
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. 
In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study. 
The condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to figures cited at the meeting Wednesday. 
Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar. 
And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15 percent, compared with just four states in 1991. 
An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity. 
The health effects of obesity have been staggering.
