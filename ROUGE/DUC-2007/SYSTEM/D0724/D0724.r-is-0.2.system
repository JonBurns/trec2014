Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday. 
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. 
In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study. 
The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the second-leading cause ( after smoking ) of preventable death in the United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care expenses or in lost productivity. 
Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative. 
Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body  system for absorbing sugar. 
And people rarely eat bagels plain.
