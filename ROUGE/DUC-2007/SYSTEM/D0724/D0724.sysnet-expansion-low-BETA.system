Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday. 
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. 
The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the second-leading cause ( after smoking ) of preventable death in the United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care expenses or in lost productivity. 
Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative. 
The condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to figures cited at the meeting Wednesday. 
He added that while there are certainly social and environmental people who live in Southern states tend eventually obesity will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels.
