The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. 
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs. 
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban treaty and believes that any action by any country to carry out nuclear test is provocative. 
He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes. 
There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials to weapons. 
Russia's assistance for Iran in the field has triggered accusations from the United States and Israel that Iran is seeking the technology for developing nuclear weapons. 
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the official said, adding that based on its convictions, Iran regards as inhuman the development of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. 
Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability.
