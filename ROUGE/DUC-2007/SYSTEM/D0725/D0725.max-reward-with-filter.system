Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs. 
The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3. 
It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons, Nouri said. 
Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices. 
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear weapons. 
" Despite Iran's location in an area where there are mounting nuclear challenges, the Iranian armed forces do not have any research program on use of nuclear energy for military purposes, " it said. 
U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as attempting to learn what local military and technological capability Iran had developed.
