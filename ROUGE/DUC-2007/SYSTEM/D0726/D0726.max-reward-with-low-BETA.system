Vice President Al Gore , criticized for not having enough women in Al Gore 's inner circle , has hired a veteran female strategist to be Al Gore 's deputy campaign manager for Al Gore 's 2000 presidential bid . 
Vice President Al Gore will take Al Gore 's first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that Al Gore has formed a campaign organization , aides to the vice president said Thursday . 
In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political trip of the campaign , Gore hoped to develop a sense of inevitability about Al Gore 's nomination even before Al Gore formally announces Al Gore 's candidacy . 
Coelho , a prominent Democratic strategist , was named general chairman of Gore 's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore 's presidential campaign . 
Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took Al Gore 's presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House . 
An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would also include Peter Knight , Clinton 's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff ; another former vice presidential chief of staff , Jack Quinn ; the current chief , Ron Klain , and former Rep. Tom Downey , D-N.Y. , who is one of Gore 's best friends . 
There 's no question about it .
