Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle Newt Gingrich's divorce by relying on a financial agreement Newt Gingrich and Newt Gingrich's wife worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former House Speaker came back to an empty home. 
In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated Newt Gingrich's own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in Newt Gingrich's divorce. 
Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of Newt Gingrich's 18-year marriage and Newt Gingrich's husband's affair. 
The Gingriches' divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and Marianne Gingrich's first. 
Attorneys for Gingrich, 56, have acknowledged Newt Gingrich had a relationship with Bisek, 33, while Newt Gingrich was married to Newt Gingrich's second wife, Marianne. 
Newt Gingrich plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when attorneys for Bisek, 33, will try to persuade a judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn over documents related to Newt Gingrich's relationship to Newt Gingrich, 56. 
Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking Marianne Gingrich's to answer questions about Marianne Gingrich's relationship with the former speaker. 
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
