The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin. 
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Robert Consalvo's's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients. 
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did. nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. 
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months. 
In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels. 
Seeff said Patricia Buchanan worried that fears about the disease, and the pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, whether they need them or not. 
In patients given interferon alone, only 5 percent had undetectable levels.
