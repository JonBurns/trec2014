Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months. 
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Robert Consalvo's's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients. 
The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin. 
According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of interferon. 
The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a powerful combination of two antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. 
One, led by researchers at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients being treated for the first time. 
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
