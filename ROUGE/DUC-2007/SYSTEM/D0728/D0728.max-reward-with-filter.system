Fisher's's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the virus. 
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did. nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. 
The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C. Many, like Mrs. Buchanan, wanted to mix ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable. 
It's all you can do to get through work. 
Rebetron, which is made by Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., has been approved for use only in people who relapse after the standard treatment for hepatitis C, which is a course of interferon injections. 
She had probably been infected 15 or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all patients, she had developed a chronic infection. 
Until recently, interferon was the only treatment.
