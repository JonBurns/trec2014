Fisher's's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the virus. 
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did. nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. 
The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C. Many, like Mrs. Buchanan, wanted to mix ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable. 
Both Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., and Serono, of Norwell, Mass., manufacture beta interferon, a drug used to slow down the debilitating neurological disease. 
However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia. 
Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side effects.
