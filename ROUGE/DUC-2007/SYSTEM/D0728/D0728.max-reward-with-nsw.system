Fisher's 's treatment , known as Rebetron , consists of Ribavirin , which simply helps another drug , interferon , fight the virus . 
The combination , Rebetron , made by Schering-Plough , reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did. nn Even when it worked , Rebetron was not considered a cure , and it had terrible side effects , including anemia , depression , suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms . 
Rebetron , made by the Schering-Plough Corp. , was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs , the only other approved treatment for the disease . 
The bundling of Rebetron , which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company , looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C. Many , like Mrs. Buchanan , wanted to mix ribavirin with another company 's interferon , and some , particularly people who had received liver transplants , needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided , but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable . 
Both Biogen , of Cambridge , Mass. , and Serono , of Norwell , Mass. , manufacture beta interferon , a drug used to slow down the debilitating neurological disease . 
In some patients , drugs can make all signs of the virus disappear , but it 's unclear how long the effect lasts .
