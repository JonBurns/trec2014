The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin. 
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Robert Consalvo  version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients. 
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did. nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. 
In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor  ability to recruit new blood vessels. 
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months. 
Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that works on hepatitis C : interferon. 
While interferon alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or stroke.
