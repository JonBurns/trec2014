The manhunt intensified again for abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said Eric Rudolph took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last week. 
Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because Eric Robert Rudolph is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because Eric Robert Rudolph was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville. 
Eric Robert Rudolph told them Rudolph stole Eric Robert Rudolph's 1977 Datsun pickup truck on July 9 and took about six months' worth of food. 
Nordmann said Eric Rudolph has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the 72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last person to have seen Rudolph. 
The FBI has posted a $1 million reward for Rudolph's capture, and Rudolph has been placed on the agency's 10-most-wanted list. 
Eric Rudolph has survived one winter on the run, despite predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and the temperature dropped, Eric Rudolph would be caught. 
McCraw said in Eric Rudolph's first public appearance since then that Eric Rudolph's leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C. 
The reward for information leading to Eric Rudolph's capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
