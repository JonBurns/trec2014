The manhunt intensified again for abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said Eric Rudolph took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last week. 
Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because Eric Robert Rudolph is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because Eric Robert Rudolph was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville. 
But if Eric Rudolph is indeed in the Nantahala forest somewhere, Eric Rudolph probably won't be spotted in downtown Andrews. 
Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a fugitive since Jan. 30, 1998, the day after Eric Robert Rudolph allegedly bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham. 
Nordmann said Eric Rudolph has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the 72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last person to have seen Rudolph. 
Last week, a task force source said the mission will not be dismantled until Rudolph's capture or proof Eric Rudolph has left the area. the large task force command post behind the town hospital, the occasional helicopter flyovers, the federal agents in the restaurants and at weekend flea markets. 
The reward for information leading to Eric Rudolph's capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
