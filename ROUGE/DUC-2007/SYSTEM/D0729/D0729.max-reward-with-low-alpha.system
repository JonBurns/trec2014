Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because Eric Robert Rudolph is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because Eric Robert Rudolph was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville. 
Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a fugitive since Jan. 30, 1998, the day after Eric Robert Rudolph allegedly bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham. 
Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the run since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a nurse. 
McCraw said in Eric Rudolph's first public appearance since then that Eric Rudolph's leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C. 
Since Eric Rudolph was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has evaded a nationwide search. 
Last week, a task force source said the mission will not be dismantled until Rudolph's capture or proof Eric Rudolph has left the area. the large task force command post behind the town hospital, the occasional helicopter flyovers, the federal agents in the restaurants and at weekend flea markets. 
Searchers found Eric Rudolph's pickup truck outside Andrews several days later.
