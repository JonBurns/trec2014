In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. 
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress. 
Clinton said Hogan was disappointed in the court decision but, " It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. " 
U.S. President Bill Clinton said today Bill Clinton has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting Bill Clinton's signature, noting that Bill Clinton's new line-item veto authority ought to be used " somewhat sparingly. " 
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto. 
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress. 
The Supreme Court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
