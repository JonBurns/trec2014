In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. 
The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997. 
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers. 
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress. 
Clinton said Hogan was disappointed in the court decision but, " It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. " 
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress. 
The Line Item Veto Act was struck down.
