In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress. 
Earlier this month, a federal judge struck down the line-item veto law as unconstitutional, but the administration has appealed that ruling directly to the Supreme Court, as mandated by Congress. 
The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997. 
The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I, 7. 
The opinion in the case, Clinton vs. City of New York, was written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices William H. Rehnquist, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the line-item veto, was ecstatic Thursday.
