In a 6-3 decision , the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution 's separation of powers between Congress , which approves legislation , and the president , who either signs it into law or vetoes it . 
In a 6-3 ruling , the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president , by altering a bill after its passage , to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress . 
The opinion in the case , Clinton vs. City of New York , was written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices William H. Rehnquist , Anthony M. Kennedy , David H. Souter , Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg . 
The case the high court decided , Clinton vs. New York City , marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act , which went into effect in January 1997 . 
Two champions of the line-item veto , Sens. John McCain , R-Ariz. , and Daniel Coats , R-Ind. , said they would keep fighting for it . 
Earlier this month , a federal judge struck down the line-item veto law as unconstitutional , but the administration has appealed that ruling directly to the Supreme Court , as mandated by Congress . 
The president , however , has no authority to erase individual provisions in legislation , the justices said . 
Most assume the privilege .
