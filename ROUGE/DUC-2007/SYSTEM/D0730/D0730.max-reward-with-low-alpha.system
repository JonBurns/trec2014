The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I, 7. 
FROM THE DECISION By Justice Stevens The Line Item Veto Act... was enacted in April 1996 and became effective on January 1, 1997.
