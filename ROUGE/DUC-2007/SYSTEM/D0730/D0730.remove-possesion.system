In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution  separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. 
The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997. 
Clinton said Hogan was disappointed in the court decision but, " It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. " 
The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court. 
The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch. 
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress. 
Most assume the privilege.
