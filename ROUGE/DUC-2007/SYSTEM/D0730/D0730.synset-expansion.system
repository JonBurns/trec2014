In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. 
Clinton said Hogan was disappointed in the court decision but, " It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. " 
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto. 
The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch. 
The law was challenged last year by a group of mostly Democratic senators, but the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge, saying President Bill Clinton had not yet used the selective veto and therefore the group had no standing to bring suit. 
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation. 
Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
