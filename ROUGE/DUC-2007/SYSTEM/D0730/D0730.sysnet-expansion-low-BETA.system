In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. 
The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. 
The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997. 
Clinton said Hogan was disappointed in the court decision but, " It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. " 
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress. 
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto. 
The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch. 
Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
