It was Goldberg , Linda Tripp said , who suggested Linda Tripp passed Linda Tripp 's tapes to the independent prosecutor , Kenneth Starr , and Goldberg , who suggested Linda Tripp talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones , the woman suing Clinton for sexual harassment . 
Linda Tripp , whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton , was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week , one of Tripp 's lawyers said Thursday . 
Lewinsky said Linda Tripp wanted to make sure jurors knew that no one asked Linda Tripp 's to lie and that Linda Tripp was not promised a job for Linda Tripp 's silence . 
Afterward , Lewinsky made it plain in Linda Tripp 's testimony to the independent counsel how Linda Tripp feels about Tripp . 
Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors , apparently explaining Linda Tripp 's motives for secretly recording 20 hours of phone conversations with Linda Tripp 's ex-friend and former White House intern , Monica Lewinsky . 
In a series of conversations last year , Lewinsky told Tripp about Linda Tripp 's White House affair with President Clinton and , allegedly , about attempts to cover it up . 
Tripp secretly recorded the tapes of Lewinsky , talking about Kenneth Starr 's affair with the president , and took the tapes to Starr , sparking his eight-month investigation .
