It was Goldberg, Linda Tripp said, who suggested Linda Tripp passed Linda Tripp's tapes to the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who suggested Linda Tripp talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman suing Clinton for sexual harassment. 
Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save Linda Tripp's from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and Linda Tripp's sworn testimony to Starr. 
Lewinsky said Linda Tripp wanted to make sure jurors knew that no one asked Linda Tripp's to lie and that Linda Tripp was not promised a job for Linda Tripp's silence. 
Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors, apparently explaining Linda Tripp's motives for secretly recording 20 hours of phone conversations with Linda Tripp's ex-friend and former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. 
By January of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky testified, but thought Linda Tripp still had a chance of persuading Linda Tripp's to keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in the Jones suit. 
Afterward, Lewinsky made it plain in Linda Tripp's testimony to the independent counsel how Linda Tripp feels about Tripp. 
Frankly, I don't know anyone who's just like Linda Tripp.
