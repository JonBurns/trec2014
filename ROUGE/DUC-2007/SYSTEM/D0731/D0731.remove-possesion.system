It was Goldberg, Linda Tripp said, who suggested Linda Tripp passed Linda Tripp  tapes to the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who suggested Linda Tripp talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman suing Clinton for sexual harassment. 
Mrs. Tripp  federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save Linda Tripp  from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and Linda Tripp  sworn testimony to Starr. 
Under criminal investigation in Maryland, Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than the one Linda Tripp had a year ago when Linda Tripp  secret tape-recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors, apparently explaining Linda Tripp  motives for secretly recording 20 hours of phone conversations with Linda Tripp  ex-friend and former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. 
Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when Linda Tripp was slinking around in Ken Starr  shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president. 
By January of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky testified, but thought Linda Tripp still had a chance of persuading Linda Tripp  to keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in the Jones suit. 
It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp.
