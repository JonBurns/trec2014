With the new grant, the Kenya Education Network is expected to connect 20 universities and research facilities to the Internet within a year and 600 primary and secondary schools within three years, Vivian Derryck, assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ), said in Nairobi Tuesday. 
On the same occasion, British Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker noted that the situation in Kenya's education sector is so critical that only 35 percent of the current seven million school-age children can expect to complete primary education. 
Kenya has a shortage of over 200 science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country, Kenyan Minister for Education Joseph Kamotho said today. 
Kenya's controversial 8-4-4 education system is to be replaced with a new school program by January 2001, according to a report submitted by the country's Education Commission of Inquiry. 
Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education monitoring and evaluation.
