WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. 
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. 
Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. wolf organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast. 
Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this perhaps as many as 17. 
If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas. 
Even wolves are having problems. 
Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
