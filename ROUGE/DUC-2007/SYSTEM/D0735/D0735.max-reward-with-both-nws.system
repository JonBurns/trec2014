WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona , federal officials said Tuesday , the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year . 
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment , perhaps next month , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast , said Paul Nickerson , a wildlife biologist who heads the agency 's regional office of endangered species in Hadley , Mass. 
Ms. Fascione said that for her , the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. wolf organization , which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration , is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast . 
Since the wolf was an endangered species , the place of wolf 's death was treated as a crime scene . 
A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Yellowstone . 
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal . 
Even wolves are having problems .
