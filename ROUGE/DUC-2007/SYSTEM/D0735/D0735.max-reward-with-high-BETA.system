In this case , though , the victim is a wolf . 
Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year , five were shot , three were recaptured for their own protection , one is missing and presumed dead , and four remain . 
The wolves , raised in captivity , are a recent reintroduction to Arizona , an attempt to re-establish the wolf . 
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment , perhaps next month , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast , said Paul Nickerson , a wildlife biologist who heads the agency 's regional office of endangered species in Hadley , Mass. 
Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona , the fifth one killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year , federal officials said Tuesday . 
The western region would be Washington , Oregon , Idaho , Montana , Wyoming , Utah , Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona . 
We departed , one by one , newcomers arrived , one by one , and I am sure that as long as the wolves were visible , someone was there to watch them do their wolf act . 
Right now , wolf said , fewer than two dozen wolves roam there .
