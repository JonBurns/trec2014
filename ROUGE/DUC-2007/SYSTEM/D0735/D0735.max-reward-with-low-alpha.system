After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. 
The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. 
WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. 
We departed, one by one, newcomers arrived, one by one, and I am sure that as long as the wolves were visible, someone was there to watch them do their wolf act. 
Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. wolf organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast. 
Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of wolf's death was treated as a crime scene. 
Right now, wolf said, fewer than two dozen wolves roam there.
