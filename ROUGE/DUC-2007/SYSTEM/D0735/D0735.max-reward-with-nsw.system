After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment , perhaps next month , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast , said Paul Nickerson , a wildlife biologist who heads the agency 's regional office of endangered species in Hadley , Mass. 
The wolves , raised in captivity , are a recent reintroduction to Arizona , an attempt to re-establish the wolf . 
WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona , federal officials said Tuesday , the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year . 
In this case , though , the victim is a wolf . 
Right now , wolf said , fewer than two dozen wolves roam there . 
Their findings , not yet published , suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States , long considered a subspecies of gray wolf , is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray . 
The southwestern region , the only one where wolves would remain endangered , would include some parts of New Mexico , Arizona and Texas . 
Perhaps it should have been , but taking out this wolf was no easy task for the lion , according to wolf .
