Even wolves are having problems. 
WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. 
The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves. 
Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves. 
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona  wilderness as part of the reintroduction program. 
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency  regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. 
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal. 
Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program. 
Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
