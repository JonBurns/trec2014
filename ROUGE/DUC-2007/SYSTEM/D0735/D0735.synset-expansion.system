After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. 
WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. 
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona wilderness as part of the reintroduction program. 
If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone who purposely wanted wolves dead. 
Perhaps the only country with lots of wolves and no outstanding problems is Romania, which has an ancient tradition of honoring wolves. 
A population of wolves listed as threatened or not listed for the law protections at all may be managed under state or Federal plans that allow some wolves to be killed and some of their habitat destroyed, as long as helping the species recover remains the overall objective. 
Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, instead of deer, elk and other wildlife. 
Even wolves are having problems.
