Oprah Winfrey knew Oprah Winfrey had to lose weight , but Oprah Winfrey has done that before , and Oprah Winfrey promised Oprah Winfrey would lose 20 pounds by our deadline . 
It may not be all Oprah , all the time , but Oprah Winfrey 's new magazine , O , comes pretty close . 
What 's Oprah 's is ours , it seems : the magazine 's sensible psychologist , Dr. Phillip C. McGraw , and its spiritual advice giver , Gary Zukav , both appear on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah 's personal counselors . 
Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because Oprah Winfrey is taping Oprah Winfrey 's show in the Bahamas this week , said Jerilyn Schultz , a publicist in Chicago . 
Schultz said Oprah Winfrey could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday , which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of Oprah Winfrey 's current contract . 
The talk show host Oprah Winfrey , a powerful figure in the book world because of Oprah 's Book Club , received a 50th Anniversary Medal from the foundation . 
Oprah Winfrey was such a big hit with Northwestern University business students that Oprah Winfrey 's been invited to teach another class . 
What was that like for Oprah Winfrey 's ? 
( I use Oprah 's first name only because the show and the magazine invite me to . )
