Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited . 
Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years , the Vanguard reported today . 
Aside from the North Atlantic , there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water ( scientists call this production of deep water ) : the Weddell Sea near Antarctica . 
Nigeria is to join the league of deep offshore oil producers in the world when the nation 's first deep water oil field commences production in the year 2003 , the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday . 
The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country 's deep water terrain could hold the key to meeting the government 's set target of increasing daily crude oil production to four million barrels per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of 2010 . 
Finally , chemical evidence shows that the production of deep water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a century or so ago , when the little ice age was ending , while production has remained strong in the North Atlantic . 
It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological ruins in deep water , partly thanks to newly developed technology .
