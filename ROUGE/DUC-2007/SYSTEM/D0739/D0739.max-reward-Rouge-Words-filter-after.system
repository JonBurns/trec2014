Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld won't do another TV series, but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again, Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld's career. 
The next, Phil Morris's resurrecting Phil Morris's recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David. 
In fact, Phil Morris hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad. 
In the last few weeks, Seinfeld has been polishing Jerry Seinfeld's show on a tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland, Australia, England, Kansas City and Des Moines. 
He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of Clinton joke's act. 
That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series. 
After the Broadway show, Seinfeld will look to develop fresh material.
