Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld won't do another TV series, but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again, Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld's career. 
Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on Jerry Seinfeld's old standup routine, preparing for a finale in Jerry Seinfeld's hometown, New York City, that will be aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9. 
The next, Phil Morris's resurrecting Phil Morris's recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David. 
In fact, Phil Morris hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad. 
While Seinfeld said that Jerry Seinfeld doesn't have a favorite episode, Jerry Seinfeld did recall with great affection the one in which Jerry Seinfeld mugs an elderly woman for her loaf of marble rye. 
During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld was asked what it was like to end the run of Jerry Seinfeld's hit comedy series. 
His show was about nothing. 
David naturally begs to differ.
