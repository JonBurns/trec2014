Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld won't do another TV series, but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again, Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld's career. 
SEINFELD-Jerry Seinfeld, who drew inspiration for Jerry Seinfeld's wildly popular show from the idiosyncrasies of New Yorkers, brings Jerry Seinfeld's act back to New York City, returning to Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up roots in a performance at the Broadhurst Theater.

The next, Phil Morris's resurrecting Phil Morris's recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David. 
Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on Jerry Seinfeld's old standup routine, preparing for a finale in Jerry Seinfeld's hometown, New York City, that will be aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9. 
The manager is in Larry David's own car, on Larry David's speakerphone, but fails to mention that Larry David's parents are in the back seat. 
David's first outing without Seinfeld was not auspicious. 
Jerry Seinfeld exclaimed.
