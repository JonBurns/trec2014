Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld won't do another TV series, but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again, Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld's career. 
The next, Phil Morris's resurrecting Phil Morris's recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David. 
The manager is in Larry David's own car, on Larry David's speakerphone, but fails to mention that Larry David's parents are in the back seat. 
Jerry Seinfeld exclaimed. 
He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of Clinton joke's act. 
SEINFELD-Jerry Seinfeld, who drew inspiration for Jerry Seinfeld's wildly popular show from the idiosyncrasies of New Yorkers, brings Jerry Seinfeld's act back to New York City, returning to Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up roots in a performance at the Broadhurst Theater. 
In fact, Phil Morris hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad. 
Larry David had no more ideas.
