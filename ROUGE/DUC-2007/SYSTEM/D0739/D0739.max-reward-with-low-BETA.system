Seinfeld has vowed that Jerry Seinfeld wo n't do another TV series , but before Jerry Seinfeld bolts off again , Jerry Seinfeld is going to perform , one final time , the stand-up comedy act Jerry Seinfeld developed throughout Jerry Seinfeld 's career . 
The next , Phil Morris 's resurrecting Phil Morris 's recurring Seinfeld character , a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles , to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David . 
The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take Seinfeld 's comedy , now that Seinfeld 's told these jokes for the last time . 
Good jokes , after all , are hard to find , which makes tonight 's show , if Seinfeld keeps his promise , a keeper for anyone with a VCR . 
He did , after all , play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series , and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of Clinton joke 's act . 
That Larry David wanders around a good bit , mumbling about life and its foibles , sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled , balding , chunky , self-proclaimed loser from a late , great hit TV series . 
Part of the genuineness , David said , is Larry David 's person ality . 
But that 's the only change , Larry David said . 
His show was about nothing .
