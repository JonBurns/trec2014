Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard's teammate for Bertrand Piccard's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon. 
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight. 
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. 
It was Auguste Piccard, Bertrand Piccard's grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel. 
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. ( 0730 GMT ) from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II. 
The Pacific crossing was sluggish at first, with the Bertrand Piccard balloon slowing at times to 30 mph. 
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon. 
No previous attempts came even close.
