Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard 's teammate for Bertrand Piccard 's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon . 
Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and Bertrand Piccard 's new teammate , British flight engineer Tony Brown , said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world . 
In August , Fossett broke Bertrand Piccard 's own distance record , traveling more than 24,461 kilometers ( 15,200 miles ) before a storm damaged Bertrand Piccard 's balloon , sending it plunging into the sea off Australia . 
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation , Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday 's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight . 
It will be Piccard 's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop . 
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium , plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain , were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. ( 0730 GMT ) from Chateau d'Oex , in western Switzerland , aboard the Breitling Orbiter II . 
The adventurers , Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England , steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico , their control center said . 
No previous attempts came even close .
