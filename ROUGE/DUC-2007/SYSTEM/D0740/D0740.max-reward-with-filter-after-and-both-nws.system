Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard's teammate for Bertrand Piccard's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon. 
By early Thursday, Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard and Bertrand Piccard's British teammate Brian Jones had passed over Taiwan and were setting a course for a six-day journey across the ocean. 
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. 
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. ( 0730 GMT ) from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II. 
Piccard said Bertrand Piccard believed the two men would work well together in the cramped conditions of the balloon's cabin. 
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said. 
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon. 
The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
