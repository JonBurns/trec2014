Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard's teammate for Bertrand Piccard's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon. 
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Breitling's co-pilot, Brian Jones, a 52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company. 
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes. 
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said. 
The Breitling Orbiter was built in England, financed and registered in Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and Brian Jones, who is British. 
It was Auguste Piccard, Bertrand Piccard's grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel. 
The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday.
