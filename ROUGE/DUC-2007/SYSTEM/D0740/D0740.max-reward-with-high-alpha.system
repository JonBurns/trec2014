Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard's teammate for Bertrand Piccard's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon. 
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Breitling's co-pilot, Brian Jones, a 52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company. 
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes. 
Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and Bertrand Piccard's new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world. 
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, an English balloonist, began their journey March 1, lifting away from the village of Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland. 
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said. 
The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through Kevin Uliassi's journey, which began in Rockford, Ill., on Feb. 22.
