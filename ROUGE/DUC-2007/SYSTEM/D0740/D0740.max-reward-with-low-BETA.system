Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard 's teammate for Bertrand Piccard 's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon . 
In February the Swiss pilot , along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten , broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon , landing in Myanmar , also Burma , after a flight lasting 9 days , 17 hours and 55 minutes . 
Piccard , a Swiss psychiatrist , and Breitling 's co-pilot , Brian Jones , a 52-year-old British balloonist , stand to win a $ 1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch , the brewing company . 
It was Auguste Piccard , Bertrand Piccard 's grandfather , who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere , the first to see the earth 's curvature firsthand , and the inventor of the pressurized cabin , which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel . 
Piccard , a Swiss psychiatrist , and Jones , an English balloonist , began their journey March 1 , lifting away from the village of Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland . 
The adventurers , Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England , steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico , their control center said . 
The trio , however , drifted further north last Monday .
