Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard 's teammate for Bertrand Piccard 's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon . 
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium , plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain , departed from Chateau d'Oex , in western Switzerland , aboard Breitling Orbiter II . 
The adventurers , Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England , steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico , their control center said . 
The Breitling Orbiter was built in England , financed and registered in Switzerland and piloted by Dr. Bertrand Piccard , who is Swiss , and Brian Jones , who is British . 
It was Auguste Piccard , Bertrand Piccard 's grandfather , who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere , the first to see the earth 's curvature firsthand , and the inventor of the pressurized cabin , which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel . 
The first two , Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain , completed a 20-day trip together last March , ending in the Egyptian desert . 
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation , Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday 's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight .
