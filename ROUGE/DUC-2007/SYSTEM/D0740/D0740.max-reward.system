Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard 's teammate for Bertrand Piccard 's next attempt at circling the world in a balloon . 
Piccard , a Swiss psychiatrist , and Breitling 's co-pilot , Brian Jones , a 52-year-old British balloonist , stand to win a $ 1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch , the brewing company . 
In February the Swiss pilot , along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten , broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon , landing in Myanmar , also Burma , after a flight lasting 9 days , 17 hours and 55 minutes . 
Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and Bertrand Piccard 's new teammate , British flight engineer Tony Brown , said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world . 
The adventurers , Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England , steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico , their control center said . 
After some slow going in the early days of the flight , Uliassi 's balloon , the J. Renee , found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100 miles an hour , said Scott Lorenz , a spokesman . 
The trio , however , drifted further north last Monday .
