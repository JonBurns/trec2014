Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that Bertrand Piccard has chosen Brian Jones as Bertrand Piccard teammate for Bertrand Piccard next attempt at circling the world in a balloon. 
Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because Bertrand Piccard failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed Bertrand Piccard departure from Switzerland this year until Bertrand Piccard got Beijing approval. 
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight. 
In August, Fossett broke Bertrand Piccard own distance record, traveling more than 24,461 kilometers ( 15,200 miles ) before a storm damaged Bertrand Piccard balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia. 
It was Auguste Piccard, Bertrand Piccard grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel. 
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m. ( 0730 GMT ) from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II. 
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
