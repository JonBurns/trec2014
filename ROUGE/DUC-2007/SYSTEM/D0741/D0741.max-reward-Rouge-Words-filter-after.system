All because of Mark Barton. 
But the securities firm where Barton began Mark Orrin Barton's shooting rampage disclosed Friday that Mark Orrin Barton had lost $the day Mark Orrin Barton went home and killed Mark Orrin Barton's wife. 
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in Mark O.'s letter that Mark O. killed Mark O.'s current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and Mark O.'s two children, 11-year-old son and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night. 
Barton noted in Mark O.'s letter that investigators might notice similarities between the deaths of Mark O.'s family members and those of Mark O.'s previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and Barton's mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer, bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade. 
In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how Mark Orrin Barton killed Mark Orrin Barton's estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned Mark Orrin Barton's two children the following day. 
Leigh Ann didn't want to have children, but Mark O. came to love Mark Barton's son and daughter like they were Mark O.'s own, Mark O.'s grandmother said. 
Barton walked toward her.
