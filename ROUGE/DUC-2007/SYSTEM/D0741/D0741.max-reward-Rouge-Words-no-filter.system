All because of Mark Barton. 
But the securities firm where Barton began Mark Orrin Barton's shooting rampage disclosed Friday that Mark Orrin Barton had lost $the day Mark Orrin Barton went home and killed Mark Orrin Barton's wife. 
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in Mark O.'s letter that Mark O. killed Mark O.'s current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and Mark O.'s two children, 11-year-old son and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night. 
Barton noted in Mark O.'s letter that investigators might notice similarities between the deaths of Mark O.'s family members and those of Mark O.'s previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and Barton's mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer, bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade. 
Barton's mother, Gladys Barton, who lives in South Carolina, released a statement Friday afternoon saying that Mark O. was deeply saddened by the shootings, but that Mark O. loved Mark O.'s son. 
Last Christmas, Mark O. Barton sat down with Barton's estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market. 
Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts, according to Atlanta police.
