A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and John F.'s sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. 
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, John F.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Kennedy Jr.'s sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where Kennedy Jr. was going. 
The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue Kennedy Jr.'s flight to the Vineyard, where Kennedy Jr. planned to drop off Kennedy Jr.'s sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. 
An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search. prompted no action by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
Members of the Kennedy family gathered at their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law. 
The wedding was postponed.
