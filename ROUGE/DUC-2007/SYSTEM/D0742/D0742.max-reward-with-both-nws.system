A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr. , Kennedy Jr. 's wife , Carolyn Bessette Kennedy , and John F. 's sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast , and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard . 
Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. , Kennedy Jr. 's wife and Kennedy Jr. 's sister-in-law , NBC News reported Thursday . 
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy , 38 , John F. 's wife , Carolyn Bessette Kennedy , 33 , and Kennedy Jr. 's sister Lauren Bessette , 34 . 
U.S. Kennedy family and friends paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr , son of the former U.S. president , Kennedy 's wife and John F. 's sister in a private memorial service in a New York church . 
The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route , meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue Kennedy Jr. 's flight to the Vineyard , where Kennedy Jr. planned to drop off Kennedy Jr. 's sister-in-law , Lauren Bessette . 
The service was held well out of the gaze of the public , which has followed every detail since Kennedy , Kennedy 's wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Kennedy 's sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane crash a week ago .
