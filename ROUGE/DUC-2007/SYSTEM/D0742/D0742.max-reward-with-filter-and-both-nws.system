A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and John F.'s sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. 
Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, Kennedy Jr.'s wife and John F.'s sister the victims of a fatal crash. 
Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife and Kennedy Jr.'s sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday. 
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as John F. was flying with John F.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sky's sister Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard. 
Kennedy, Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the shore of Martha's Vineyard. 
The wreckage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said. 
It was his third birthday.
