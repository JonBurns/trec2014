The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, John F.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Kennedy Jr.'s sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as John F. was flying with John F.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sky's sister Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard. 
A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and John F.'s sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. 
Killed were Kennedy, 38, Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette. 
Kennedy, Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the shore of Martha's Vineyard. 
Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. 
It was his third birthday. 
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president. 
That, too, was a false alert.
