The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, John F.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Kennedy Jr.'s sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman. 
A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and John F.'s sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. 
Kennedy, 38, Kennedy's wife, 33, and her sister, 34, were killed when the small private plane Kennedy was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off the Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States on July 16. 
Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.'s wife and Kennedy Jr.'s sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday. 
Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass. 
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president. 
The wedding was postponed.
