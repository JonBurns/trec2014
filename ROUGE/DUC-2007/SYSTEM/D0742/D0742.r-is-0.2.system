Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr.  wife and Kennedy Jr.  sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday. 
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, John F.  wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Kennedy Jr.  sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
Members of the Kennedy family gathered at their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy  wife and sister-in-law. 
Kennedy, Kennedy  wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the shore of Martha Vineyard. 
U.S. Kennedy family and friends paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr, son of the former U.S. president, Kennedy  wife and John F.  sister in a private memorial service in a New York church. 
The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue Kennedy Jr.  flight to the Vineyard, where Kennedy Jr. planned to drop off Kennedy Jr.  sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. 
Two flatbed trucks under police escort transported wreckage from the John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash to the Coast Guard hangar where it will be examined in detail by federal investigators. 
The wedding was postponed.
