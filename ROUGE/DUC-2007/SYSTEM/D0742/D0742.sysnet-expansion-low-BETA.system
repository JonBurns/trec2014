A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr. wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and John F. sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard. 
Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., Kennedy Jr. wife and Kennedy Jr. sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday. 
The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue Kennedy Jr. flight to the Vineyard, where Kennedy Jr. planned to drop off Kennedy Jr. sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette. 
U.S. Kennedy family and friends paid their last respects Friday to John F. Kennedy Jr, son of the former U.S. president, Kennedy wife and John F. sister in a private memorial service in a New York church. 
An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr. plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search. prompted no action by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where Kennedy Jr. was going. 
Kennedy body was identified within three hours.
