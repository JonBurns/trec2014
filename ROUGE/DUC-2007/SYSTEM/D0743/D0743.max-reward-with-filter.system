Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid, including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and garbage trucks. 
Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake. 
The quake almost leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, as well as other towns in western Turkey. 
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, with a population of 12 million, lies just 65 miles west of Izmit, and may be the next place to feel the fault's wrath. 
A 4.2-magnitude aftershock followed.
