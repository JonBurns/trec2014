Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid, including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and garbage trucks. 
Over 10,000 people are estimated to be still trapped in the ruins of the destroyed buildings and houses in the stricken provinces of Istanbul, Kocaeli ( Izmit ), Sakarya ( Adapazari ), Yalova, Bursa, Bolu, Eskisehir, Zonguldak, and Tekirdag. 
Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake. 
Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
