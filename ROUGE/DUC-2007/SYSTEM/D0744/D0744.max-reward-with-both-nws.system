The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that , even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country , the conventional food industry is worried . 
More than two years after the federal government 's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval , the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label . 
Last year , when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food , more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations . 
Talking about the future of the organic food industry , Liu Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with great potential . 
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s , organic food came to account for $ 1 of every $ 100 spent on food , and in 1997 the agency took notice , proposing national organic standards for all food . 
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $ 6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops , irradiation and sewage sludge . 
For years organic foods were bit players in the food industry . 
Consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores .
