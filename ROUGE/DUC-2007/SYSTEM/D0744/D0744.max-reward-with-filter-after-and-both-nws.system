The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried. 
More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label. 
Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations. 
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food. 
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies. 
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge. 
The rapid development of China's organic food industry has attracted the international attention. 
Stossel will make the correction.
