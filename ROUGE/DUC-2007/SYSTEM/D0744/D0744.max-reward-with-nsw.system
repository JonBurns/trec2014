The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that , even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country , the conventional food industry is worried . 
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s , organic food came to account for $ 1 of every $ 100 spent on food , and in 1997 the agency took notice , proposing national organic standards for all food . 
Last year , when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food , more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations . 
Whole Foods Market Inc. , based in Austin , Texas , which has 92 stores around the country selling gourmet and organic food , also signed . 
Today , with more organic choices than ever , from beef to baby food , and with more markets stocking the goods , organic is going mainstream . 
More than two years after the federal government 's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval , the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label . 
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad , where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies . 
Which seems fairly natural .
