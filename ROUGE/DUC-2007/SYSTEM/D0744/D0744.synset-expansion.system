The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried. 
Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations. 
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food. 
More than two years after the federal government first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label. 
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies. 
Some organic farmers say an even bigger threat is pollination from the genetically-altered plant seeping from conventional farms to organic farms. an organic food company in Hudson, Wis., said he was forced to recall over $100,000 worth of organic tortilla chips that had been contaminated with genetically-engineered corn. 
Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming.
