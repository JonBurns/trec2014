In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths of Ms. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson's friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. 
O.J. Simpson will keep custody of Simpson's two young children in a settlement with the parents of Simpson's slain ex-wife, Simpson's lawyer said Monday. 
Simpson, 49, was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal trial for the slashing murders of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Simpson's friend Ronald Goldman, but the victims' relatives filed a civil wrongful death suit against him, seeking monetary damages. 
Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and Simpson's slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother's parents. 
The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Nicole Brown Simpson's friend, Ronald Goldman. 
The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody case could go back to court for a second trial because a judge had failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Nicole Brown Simpson's friend, Ronald Goldman. 
Simpson is appealing the judgment.
