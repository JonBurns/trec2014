It 's been six years since Sinead O'Connor earned a permanent place in the Hall of Fierce when O'Connor shredded a photograph of Pope John Paul II , and intoned , `` Fight the real enemy , '' on `` Saturday Night Live . '' 
Sure , O'Connor evoked the wrath of Catholics , including a hypocritical Madonna . 
But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an industry lousy with pretense . 
Here was a beautiful woman who desexualized herself by shaving O'Connor 's head , a fiesty zealot with the voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine . 
O'Connor championed Public Enemy , flipped off the Grammys , and was threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled Banner . 
O'Connor actions were so jaw-droppingly over , it was hard not to admire their raw loopiness , though they overshadowed O'Connor 's talent and undermined record sales . 
Now 31 and twice a mother , O'Connor seems a bit less prickly . 
In the current Spin , O'Connor , on the road this suumer as part of the Lilith Fair , tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets about actions which brought her grief in the past . 
`` I respect myself for being the age that I was and having this passion and integrity that I did have , '' she says . 
`` I can say about the Pope thing , I would n't do now because they 're just ( expletive ) young moody ( expletive ) . '' Likewise , she has little regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a fashion accessory . 
`` I suppose it bothers me that people like them have sold a lot more records than I ever sold . 
They do n't cause trouble and they play a game . 
They 're not controversial in any way . '' 
Speaking of playing games , is Jesse Camp for real ? 
Is Camp , anointed the newest idiot in MTV 's village after beating 4,000 others in the network 's `` I Wanna Be a VJ '' contest in April , really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one of his wool leg warmers over our eyes ? 
It seems like it may be the latter . 
His dad , J. Holden Camp , chairman of the humanities department at the University of Hartford , tells Spin his son , whose real name is Josh , `` is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a facade . 
Spangled Banner did well in school , and Spangled Banner had a lot of fun with drama . '' 
Looks like Spangled Banner still is .

P.O.V. , the men 's magazine which is Details without urban cool or female readership , continues to genuflect to the guilt-free guyness which ( thankfully ) has n't been on public display since Frank , Ketel One gets a A+ for its `` there 's Scott Bindley 's entertaining mini-opus , `` In Defense of Bachelorhood . '' 
According to Bindley , married life can be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers , minivans , and sex as often as the World Cup . 
Hence , men should be live it up as bachelors . 
Singledom , he says , means more time and money for a cool sports car , titanium golf clubs , and a satellite dish which can get every sporting event from Little League to logrolling . 
But Bindley is quick to say everything bachelors writes `` is predicated on the belief that the Star existence should be temporary . 
We are not advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa 's bachelors-Man Women-Haters Club . ''

The women of Bust seem like they could n't care less if they make men uncomfortable . 
This smart New York-based quarterly is dedicated to celebrating all things female , and if the boys ca n't handle it , well , they do n't have to go home , but they 've got to the heck the out of here . 
In short , chicks rule .

For nearly a decade , Queen Latifah , the first lady of hip-hop , has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether O'Connor prefers princesses to princes in O'Connor 's queendom . 
Speculation on O'Connor 's sexuality only intensified after O'Connor played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996 urban caper `` Set It Off . '' 
So in the current issue of The Source , O'Connor pumps `` Order in the Court , '' O'Connor 's first CD in five years , and gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls . 
Mostly , though , O'Connor talks about those rumors . 
`` I have no problems with my sexuality , whatever you wanna think I am , '' the woman born Dana Owens tells writer Amy Linden . 
`` I 'll never answer the question . 
I 'd rather have you die wanting to know . 
You can assume whatever you want . 
I 'm me . 
I 'm not ashamed of who I am , and who I sleep with is nobody 's businesses.not that there 's anything wrong with that . 
In the same issue , Morris Dees , leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center , gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column . 
Dees has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation . 
But then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC 's list of hate groups. with drama . '' 
Looks , `` If you want to make friends and influence people in the ' hood , dissing ( Louis ) Farrakhan and the Nation is not the place to start . '' 
Perhaps . 
But since Farrakhan has made anti-Semitic remarks , as well as homophobic and misogynistic comments , Farrakhan belongs on Dees 's list . 
So to the Source , that slap is right back at ' cha .
