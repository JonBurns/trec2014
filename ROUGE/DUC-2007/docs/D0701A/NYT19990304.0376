An hour past midnight , pastor Jonathan Mouzon sped toward Jonathan Mouzon 's country church as fast as Jonathan Mouzon 's Chevy Lumina could carry him . 
A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball . 
Two days earlier , the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of Macedonia Baptist Church . 
A skull and crossbones on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning : `` is watching you . '' 
No one would torch a house of God , not even the Klan , Mouzon thought . 
By the time Jonathan Mouzon pulled up , what looked like a tornado of fire swirled from the middle of the church roof . 
Before sunrise , Macedonia 's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American church fires investigated in the South since 1995 . 
An uneasiness prevailed . 
`` You were constantly looking over your shoulder , '' said Mouzon , a shift supervisor for a security company . 
So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice , some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical . 
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy . 
Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971 , Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife , carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat , burn and kill . 
He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank account . 
Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations , a white supremacist group in Idaho . 
On Jan. 25 , the Montgomery , Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi members . 
The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the Klan : seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard Butler . 
Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan , a group he said recruited throughout the Carolinas. inciting the fire that destroyed Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21 , 1995 . 
By the next summer , Macedonia stood again . 
Tucked away in one of South Carolina 's poorest counties , the church took out a $ 100,000 loan , built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for the first time in Mouzon 's 13 years as pastor . 
Dees said he could win a multimillion-one for $ 7 million in Mobile , Ala. , another for $ 1 million in Forsyth County , Ga. 
He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from Klan intimidation . 
`` He was not this enormous person that you read about . 
He was one of you , '' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church , its floors covered by carpet as red as Santa 's suit . 
Macedonia signed on . 
As he does in all his cases , Dees charged the church nothing . 
Last summer , his litigators and investigators secured a $ 37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan . 
Even after a court reduced the damages to $ 20 million , it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed against a hate group . 
The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the dollar for every successful civil judgment . 
All money realized from settlements is given to the victims . 
What the lawsuits have done , even some Klan leaders have conceded , is make extremist activity a bad investment , diminishing the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups . 
In most of the cases pursued by Dees , the defendants also have lost what little property they held . 
SWAYED BY RECORD To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders , Dees told them about Beulah Mae Donald , the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael Donald , who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981 . 
Then 64 , the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United Klans of America . 
She wanted neither vengeance nor money . 
Jonathan Mouzon wanted justice for Michael . 
Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan . 
Bank records showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30 states . 
Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters in Tuscaloosa . 
Former Klan members testified that UKA President Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks . 
The conspiracy trial lasted four days . 
An all-white jury of six found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $ 7 million to Beulah Mae Donald . 
The UKA as a machine of hatred had been shut down . 
`` The Klan of yesteryear is dead , '' Ku Klux Klan said in a 1995 interview . 
`` Society 's changing . 
You ca n't have parades Ku Klux Klan in robes anymore . 
... 
The public wo n't go along with it . 
The Klan is gone . 
It will never return . '' 
Donald received the deed to the Klan faction 's $ the closest she ever got to the $ 7 million awarded by the jury . 
She sold the property for half its appraised value and bought her first house . 
Donald died in 1988 , a year after the trial . 
ASSETS UNDER ATTACK although it never amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines . 
In military terms , Dees goes after command and control centers . 
Mouzon 's church eventually may get only $ 200,000 , if that , the law center said , from the Christian Knights and Horace King , the South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of the Macedonia Baptist Church . 
That 's only a penny on the dollar . 
But it will put King on the street and , theoretically , the Klan out of business . 
Hate groups are paying attention to Dees ' tactics . 
One white supremacist group , fearful of being sued by Dees , transferred its assets to another organization . 
A federal court ruled in 1996 against the attempted evasion , and the law center now is trying to collect an $ 85,000 judgment . 
A 1996 edition of the `` Florida InterKlan Report , '' a publication `` serving the Florida Klan cartel , '' focused on Dees ' efforts in Manning . 
The advice : disband immediately . 
`` The Klan will always be around under one name or another , '' the newsletter said . 
`` Do n't appeal for defense funds . 
Close your bank accounts . 
Forget about lawyers . '' 
A CRUCIAL LINK But proving organized hate is n't as easy as showing pictures of flaming crosses to a jury . 
Newsletters , and Web sites stewing in fiery rhetoric are n't enough for conviction . 
The convincing tie-in comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan , linking rhetoric to violence . 
In the case of King , the South Carolina grand dragon , the law center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in Washington . 
In the tape , shown to jurors , King talks about blacks and yells , `` If we had this garbage in South Carolina , we would burn the bastards out ! '' 
On top of that , Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to burn black churches . 
King postponed one church fire , fearing the Klan would be suspected . 
King 's attorney , Ku Klux Klan of Columbia , S.C. , relied on a First Amendment defense : Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected free speech . 
`` That 's not an easy pitch to a jury , '' Jonathan Mouzon said . 
`` It was ugly and inflammatory , but that 's what the First Amendment is all about . '' 
White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only `` a couple of acres and a small , run-down house on it . '' 
However , Jonathan Mouzon , legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center , argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot soldiers . 
`` The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not the kind of thing he would just shrug off , '' Jonathan Mouzon said . 
`` That 's the kind of thing that has a lasting impact . 
When you 're going off to the Klan rally and you 're saying goodbye to your wife , Ku Klux Klan 's not real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these people you may lose your home . '' 
Tactics questioned Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut conspiracies costs a bundle . 
Dees estimates the Manning investigation cost nearly $ $ 500,000 if attorney time had been charged . 
Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising . 
From 1992 to 1997 , it raised $ 102 million , according to its federal tax filings . 
Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came from more than 300,000 private contributors . 
During the same time , the group spent $ 15 million on fund-more than 22 cents of every dollar consumed by total expenses . 
In 1974 , the law center started with an endowment of $ 72,775 . 
Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses . 
In 1997 , the endowment topped $ $ 89.6 million of it invested in equity securities . 
The organization 's net assets exceeded $ 97 million . 
Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , which was once pastored by the Rev. Ku Klux Klan 's , the law center will begin construction next month of a $ 10 million , six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters . 
Dees drew a $ 205,339 salary in 1996 as the center 's chief trial counsel and chairman of its executive committee . 
He contributed $ 19,458 to the employee benefit plan , according to the center 's 1996 federal tax form . 
Tom Turnipseed , a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for South Carolina attorney general last November , helped Dees get in touch with Macedonia Baptist Church . 
`` Morris loves to raise money , '' said Turnipseed , a distant relative of Dees'. `` but they 're good . 
Jonathan Mouzon knows how to get people to give him the money . '' 
In a recent fund-raising letter , Turnipseed said , his return envelope came with `` about six different stamps . 
It was like they had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents . '' 
Smaller civil rights groups , like the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta , which started as the Anti-Klan Network , wonder why the law center needs so much money . 
`` It appears they 're just sitting on it . 
The community does n't see the product , '' said Chris Freeman , a Center for Democratic Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery group . 
`` But the question is : Where are the funds going ? 
Their research is geared to groups like us , munity . '' 
The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders , who lob their bombast in newsletters and on the Internet . 
Tom Metzger , head of the White Aryan Resistance , lost a $ 12.5 million suit in 1990 to Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant . 
Ku Klux Klan pays $ 845 a month to the victim 's estate . 
Less than affectionately , Metzger calls Ku Klux Klan 's nemesis `` Morris Sleaze . '' 
`` Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due , '' Metzger once wrote . 
`` He has compiled the largest direct mail financial sucker list in the country . '' 
The core of the law center 's program is `` Teaching Tolerance , '' a classroom program started in 1991 . 
A magazine that promotes `` interracial and intercultural understanding '' goes to more than 400,000 teachers . 
The program features books , videos and posters costing up to $ 30 each . 
The law center also funds a three-year , $ 100,000 civil rights litigation program in Georgia . 
The program is designed to stem federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal assistance to poor people in civil actions . 
Mouzon , the Macedonia pastor , said Jonathan Mouzon does n't begrudge the law center one cent . 
`` Not at all , '' Jonathan Mouzon said , `` because we know firsthand what they do . 
Jonathan Mouzon knew we did n't have any money to accept representation . '' 
THEY TEND TO RUN As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young 's Country Mart near Manning , pallet makers from a nearby mill buy quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter . 
`` Maybe a few of them graduated from high school , '' said Jesse Young , a trustee at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the convenience store . 
One of the regulars is Romeo Haley . 
Horace King and Virgil Griffin , the main defendants in the Macedonia fire . 
Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders , Romeo Haley says race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit . 
`` I do n't think it 's changed except that people have hid themselves and run . 
Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan . '' 
Haley said he `` never had no use '' for the Klan . 
`` They 're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause , '' he said . 
`` They 're fed up with the federal government , but they 'll get scared and run in a minute . 
There are people who planted the tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit , they ran . '' 
Since the civil verdict , a healing spirit has touched Macedonia . 
Mouzon plans a church picnic for Ku Klux Klan 's country community . 
Timothy Welch , one of those convicted for setting the blaze , grew up in the area , climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing with church members ' kids . 
Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown to hate him . 
Welch 's mother , Wanda , has attended recent Sunday services . 
Each time , she apologized to the congregation . 
But there 's no need , Mouzon said . 
All is forgiven . 
`` We 're trying to move past it , '' he said . 
`` It comes up occasionally . 
But we 're trying to forget . '' 
FINANCING LAWSUITS FOR THE POOR The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have assets totaling around $ 100 million . 
But the civil rights organization still spends most of its money on programs to help poor people .
