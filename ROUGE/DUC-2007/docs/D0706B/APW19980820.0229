Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end Aung San Suu Kyi 's road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of Aung San Suu Kyi 's political party . 
Suu Kyi 's health was also `` failing '' according to a statement released Thursday by the National League for Democracy , Aung San Suu Kyi 's political party . 
Citing Aung San Suu Kyi 's personal physicians , who have visited Aung San Suu Kyi 's twice in Aung San Suu Kyi 's van outside Yangon , Aung San Suu Kyi 's eyes are turning yellow and Aung San Suu Kyi has low blood pressure , the party statement said . 
Aung San Suu Kyi doctors took blood samples , fearing Aung San Suu Kyi may have contracted jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in Aung San Suu Kyi 's car with three colleagues 32 kilometers ( 19 miles ) outside Yangon . 
Suu Kyi is engaged in Aung San Suu Kyi 's fourth confrontation in two months with the military government over Aung San Suu Kyi 's right to travel freely within Myanmar , also known as Burma . 
Aung San Suu Kyi was stopped outside Yangon last Wednesday by the authorities as Aung San Suu Kyi attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet with members of parliament from Aung San Suu Kyi 's party . 
The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of parliament and other members of Aung San Suu Kyi 's party imprisoned since May . 
There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar 's prisons , according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front , an exile group . 
The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear , as Suu Kyi has said in the past that when people are arrested in far flung provinces the party sometimes does n't hear about it . 
There was no immediate response from the military government to Suu Kyi 's demand . 
In the past , they have never met Aung San Suu Kyi 's calls to release political prisoners or begin a dialogue . 
Suu Kyi 's offer to end Aung San Suu Kyi 's protest comes one day before Aung San Suu Kyi 's party 's deadline for the military to convene parliament . 
The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the demand . 
`` The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists no constitution , '' said a government spokesman , on condition of anonymity . 
`` The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald person to dye Yangon 's hair . '' 
Several ethnic insurgent groups , exiled democracy activists and Western governments have supported the NLD 's call for parliament to be convened . 
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990 election , but the military refused to honor the results . 
After the NLD victory , it denied the election was for a parliament , but instead for delegates to a convention to write a new constitution . 
The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on gives the military the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi from holding public office . 
The military has ruled Myanmar , also known as Burma , since 1962 . 
In 1988 , the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a nationwide democracy uprising .
