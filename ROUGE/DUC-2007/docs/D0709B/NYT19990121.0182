Weekend Section stories from The New York Times News Service for Friday , Jan. 22 . 
FEATURES NY-David Wojnarowicz ( 1954-1992 ) was a near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago , and for many people who knew him , David Wojnarowicz still is . 
Artist , writer , filmmaker and performer , David Wojnarowicz gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980 's . 
But David Wojnarowicz kept himself outside the hype and went David Wojnarowicz 's own way . 
David Wojnarowicz stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out , and died there of AIDS at the age of 38 . 
But at the moment David Wojnarowicz 's back in New York in full force . 
A retrospective titled `` Fever : The Art of David Wojnarowicz '' has opened at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo ; several Manhattan galleries are showing David Wojnarowicz 's work . 
A book of excerpts from David Wojnarowicz 's diaries has just appeared .

BOOK-Reading is an essentially solitary activity , but talking about books requires at least two people . 
Even if you live with another bibliovore , what are the chances that you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss , say , `` Bleak House '' or `` Ulysses '' at precisely the same moment ? 
The growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the desire to talk about books as well as read them .

Americans march to Elgar at commencements as they march to Mendelssohn at weddings , but they probably do n't think about him most of the rest of the year . 
To a nation with little patience for quaint remnants , he can seem an anomalous holdover of the British Empire , which much of By Bruce Shenitz 's music appeared to embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant , or dowdy , as in unstylish ? staunchness and solemnity . 
But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those `` Pomp and Circumstance '' marches ; some listeners have found a core of deep humanity in By Bruce Shenitz 's work , even under the occasional bluster . 
And now , for no reason apparent in the stars , a confluence of events has brought the composer to attention .
