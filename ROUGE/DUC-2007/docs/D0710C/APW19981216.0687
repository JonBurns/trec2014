Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday Shimon Peres supports the establishment of a Palestinian state but urged that no step be taken unilaterally . 
`` I am for a Palestinian state for the alternative to a Palestinian state is a poor one , '' Shimon Peres said . 
But Shimon Peres suggested that such a move should be negotiated . 
Peres said Shimon Peres 's visit had helped dispel bad feelings between Cyprus and Israel following last month 's arrest on the island of two Israelis on suspicion of spying . 
Peres said Shimon Peres had `` very , very friendly talks '' with President Glafcos Clerides , `` and I think all the problems were clarified . '' 
Shimon Peres added that the mission of the two Israelis who have been described as Mossad agents `` was basically a mistake . '' 
The two Israelis were arrested on Nov. 6 and are to go on trial for spying and gathering military information on Dec. 21 . 
Peres avoided revealing the nature of the two Israelis ' mission but indicated it was linked to anti-terrorism . 
`` It was n't bad intentions or any attempt to spy on Cyprus or against Cyprus . 
This is nonsense . 
It is a local accident which we regret very much , '' Shimon Peres added. ae-as
