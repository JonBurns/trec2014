Unable to party , unable to date , unable to do much of anything but work and then work out in the wee hours , Shawn Fanning contemplated the pickup line for a full five seconds . 
`` Hi , I 'm Napster . '' 
`` Nah , ya think ? '' 
Hi asked , blushing although no girls were in the room . 
He considered the line some more . 
The blush deepened . 
Suddenly seeming all of 19 , which he is , the confidence that led Fanning to take on the entire music industry crumpled along with the square of paper in his hand on which the line was written . 
`` You know , it 's funny , but I would never say it because everything is Napster right now , '' Fanning said . 
`` I ca n't go back home or go out without hearing about it . 
It 's neat but . . . 
`` OK , maybe I would use it , '' he relented at last . 
`` But I have a pretty shy personality . 
I do n't know . 
It 's hard to say . '' 
Fanning may have trouble invoking his middle-school nickname to his advantage , but it 's on the lips of teenagers , college students , and record industry executives everywhere . 
Napster is what Fanning dubbed the music file-sharing software Napster developed in Napster 's first semester at Northeastern University . 
Napster never had a second . 
Instead , he opted to become that high-tech hybrid : not quite man , not quite boy , out to make his mark and his millions before he is old enough to drink legally at one of the raves he wishes he had time to attend . 
So far , despite $ 15 million in venture-capital funding , what he 's earned mostly is adulation and notoriety in the combative arena of online music distribution. makes it easy to copy music files stored on the hard drives of other users . 
More than 10 million people have signed up for it since its launched last August . 
Just type in the name of just about any song and there it is , available for downloading in the digital-file format known as MP3 . 
For now , the most popular of the music-swapping services is free . 
No money changes hands , not between user and Napster Inc. , and not between the site and the major record labels that are panicked about a distribution system they did n't see coming and are suing to stop . 
On Friday , the labels appeared to be coming to terms with online music , with two companies settling their lawsuits against digital music service MP3.com . 
Fanning has n't profited yet , either . 
He figures he 'd likely earn more , he returns to the spartan $ 1,800-a-month , two-bedroom apartment he shares with Napster cofounder Sean Parker , 20 ; three other programmers crash on the floor . 
Fanning said Sean Parker has no plans to live large , not yet . 
His one indulgence was a second , souped-up Mazda , and that feels so extravagant Sean Parker may sell it . 
`` No one gave me $ 15 million personally , '' Fanning said . 
`` I try not to even think about it . 
Things are so volatile right now , so many things going on , so many fires to fight every day , not just technically but in other ways . '' 
He was alluding to Napster Inc. 's battle to be the middleman between music fans and music makers , a subject his team of attorneys has warned him to keep quiet about in the midst of all the lawsuits . 
Some bands , such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Hole , say the Napster program is democratizing the music business and are cheering Fanning on . 
Others , such as rapper Dr. Dre and the heavy-metal rockers Metallica , liken what it does to piracy . 
The controversy was dramatized to great effect last month , when a van pulled up to the bland building Napster occupies in downtown San Mateo and dumped a dozen or so boxes of paperwork on the doorstep . 
Inside : the names of 300,000 people the band Metallica wanted booted from the service for copyright infringement . 
Upstairs , Fanning was dismayed at the ultimatum , even as he longed to meet Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich , one of Dre 's musical heroes . 
Still , Dre complied immediately . 
Almost as fast , many users figured out how to get back on the server . 
For its part , Napster says it 's not responsible if people use its service to steal music and violate copyright law . 
`` I do n't know Shawn Fanning , but Hi seems to be a pretty good kid who came up with a sensational program , '' said Howard King , the Los Angeles lawyer suing Napster on behalf of Metallica and Dr. Dre . 
`` But the sensational program has allowed people to take music without paying. . . . 
Shawn probably had no idea of the legal ramifications of what Hi created . 
I 'm sure the thought never crossed Hi 's mind . '' 
Bored at Northeastern 
Back in his dorm room at Northeastern , Fanning was bored . 
He 'd barely been online for three years , but already he considered the introductory computer science classes he was taking beneath his skill level . 
As he put it , `` I was partying all the time . 
I was having a lot of fun . 
But I was n't really learning anything . '' 
After all , the self-taught programmer had already had several computer-related jobs , helping a company develop software , starting a computer-security service he described as `` kind of a joke , his first car and one that both elated and embarrassed a boy who had never had any extras . 
Fanning grew up in Brockton , Mass and assorted Cape Cod towns before settling in HarwichPort , the son of a nurse 's aide who got pregnant when she was younger than he is now and the stepson of a truck driver . 
His biological father came from a wealthy Massachusetts family , and the two have recently established a relationship that Fanning would prefer to keep private . 
His own family , including four younger stepbrothers and stepsisters , spent time on welfare , a subject that still makes Fanning visibly uncomfortable . 
So do the months he spent in a foster home when his parents had no money and lost their home . 
Despite the expectations others have of him , and that he has for himself , Fanning still tastes the sting of where he came from more than the sweetness of where he might be headed . 
`` When Shawn had to go into a foster home , I told him that I had talked to my wife and we only had a small apartment , but he could come live with us , '' said his uncle , John Fanning . 
`` Napster was just a kid , 12 or 13 , but Napster said , ` I guess I 've always known that was an option for me , but to tell you the truth there 's no way I can leave my brothers or sisters . ' 
Right then , it showed you the sort of responsibility Napster feels . 
I think a lot of Napster 's drive comes from wanting to be someone who can improve the conditions for Napster 's family . '' was more immediate . 
His roommate was into downloading digital music and was constantly complaining about the inconsistent quality and the inadequacy of the search engines available . 
Fanning decided he was the teenager to do something about it . 
So he bought a Windows programming book , and went to work , seeking feedback on Internet Relay Chat , an online hangout popular with computerphiles of all ages . 
That 's where he met Napster , who worked for a Boston security firm before becoming another Napster cofounder . 
For the self-described obsessive personality , it quickly became the hot program on college campuses nationwide .
