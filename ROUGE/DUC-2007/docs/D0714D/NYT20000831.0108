My late father often entertained cops at his secondhand store on the west side of Chicago . 
They popped in to make sure he was n't peddling stolen goods . 
When they left , Daddy did n't go with them , so I assume Daddy was clean , or at least very clever . 
If he 'd been busted , I somehow doubt that any major corporations would have come to his defense . 
But some purveyors of stolen goods have friends in high places . 
Just look at who 's going to bat for Napster , the Internet music-swapping company . 
At the behest of the recording industry , US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster , where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them. that Napster 's primary business is the facilitation of thievery . 
Daddy ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music . 
An Appeals Court stayed Patel 's order , giving Napster 's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup . 
Meanwhile , an extraordinary group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the company . 
The Association of American Physicians Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case , along with Eagle Forum , a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment . 
Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet . 
They warn that corporations may use the Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products . 
`` What if the owner of ( the drug ) bat for Napster asserted its intellectual property rights , and demanded that Yahoo only provide authorized links on bat for Napster ? '' this brief thunders . 
`` The outcome would be that criticism of the use of bat for Napster would be effectively silenced . '' 
But the record companies are n't complaining about people who post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album . 
They 're upset about people stealing it , with the help of a company founded to facilitate such theft . 
Consider the following quote from a Napster official : `` We are not just making pirated music available , but pushing demand . '' the Consumer Electronics Association , the Digital Future Coalition , and the Computer Communications Industry Association . 
Among them , these three groups represent most of the world 's biggest providers of computer hardware and software , home electronics gear , and Internet services . 
Peter Jaszi , a law professor at American University , helped write this amicus brief . 
`` The brief certainly does n't say that Napster should win or Napster should lose , '' Jaszi insists . 
Still , their argument takes aim at the heart of Patel 's ruling , by making a point with a good deal of merit . 
`` When there are technologies that have multiple uses , some obviously good and some perhaps bad , copyright law ought not to be a means for stamping out those technologies , '' Jaszi argues . 
Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette recorders ? 
In 1981 , Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony Corp. for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders. ban Betamax . 
Believe it or not , a federal Appeals Court agreed . 
Fortunately , the US Supreme Court stepped in . 
In 1984 , the court ruled that even if VCRs could be used to steal the studios ' intellectual property , the devices also had many legitimate uses . 
It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether , merely to prevent its abuse . 
Patel did n't try to ban Napster . 
Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music . 
The fact that this restriction threatens the company 's doom tells you all you need to know. the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods . 
Yes , I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue . 
But that does n't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted , dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned .
