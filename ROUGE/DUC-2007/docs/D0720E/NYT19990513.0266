For the first time in Israel 's history , its upcoming election is about who will control the Interior Ministry , not the Foreign Ministry . 
It 's about what kind of Israel , not what size of Israel . 
Although he did n't set out to do this , no one is more responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . 
By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements , he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process . 
It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal with Yasser Arafat , and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist . 
It is no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian state while Likud rejects it . 
Thanks to Netanyahu , there is now a loosely unified core of 75 percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a Palestinian state of some size or other . 
With that sort of consensus in the middle , who cares who controls the Foreign Ministry ? 
Unfortunately , though , Netanyahu did not knock down the wall between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two sides . 
He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it , while all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters that he was not abandoning their cause . 
It may have been that the only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo , without triggering a civil war , was by Netanyahu winking , nodding , lying , blaming everything on Labor , the Ashkenazi elites and `` the leftists , '' and constantly bashing Arafat , whether Yasser Arafat was living up to Yasser Arafat 's commitments or not . 
Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to and Yasser Arafat accommodated them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who delivered it . 
Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu : He brought but he stayed out of it himself . 
That is , he never wanted to take ownership of it , and he still does n't . 
Bibi struck important deals that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner , but Arafat still runs against him in this election . 
In 1996 , Bibi won because a majority of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo , the Rabin assassination and the blowing up of Israeli buses . 
But thanks , in part , to his own real success at winning better Palestinian security compliance , a majority of Israelis now accept Oslo . 
In other words , thanks to Bibi 's having routinized the peace process , many Israelis want to get on with it , finish it and look to the future . 
But instead of leading that parade , Netanyahu is shying away from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past . 
He repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up in Jerusalem . 
Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process , he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future . 
His campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope , and when you ca n't give hope , when you can not educate , when you can not articulate people 's aspirations , when you can not unify , you can not lead . 
I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded identical themes , although neither knows the other . 
One was from a religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron Yaacov , Victor Friedman ( no relation ) . 
Victor wrote : `` Even people who hate the left , and ca n't imagine voting for Ehud Barak , are tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since Bibi came to power . 
The lying , trickery , corruption , divisiveness , people do n't like it . '' 
The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer , Laura Blumenfeld , who wrote that Israel today is suffering from `` Multiple Hebron thought Arafat could hold onto power by dividing everyone into squabbling tribes . 
Arafat was wrong . 
The shot that killed Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions . 
But after three years of bumping and biting each other 's necks , people are tired . '' 
By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace , Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never before . 
But by doing it in such a divisive fashion , he has also a longing that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy . 
On Monday we will find out if Bibi can survive Bibism .
