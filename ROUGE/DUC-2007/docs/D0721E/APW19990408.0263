A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial , saying they `` gravely injured '' the defendant 's right to a fair trial . 
`` There exists a very real danger that counsel 's playing to the media has already gravely injured , or at least made much more difficult , the prospect of seating a jury in this case , '' Judge Barton R. Voigt wrote Thursday . 
Voigt 's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson . 
Matthew Shepard has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard , a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten . 
Matthew Shepard received two life sentences . 
Matthew Shepard admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying him to a fence , but said Matthew Shepard tried to intervene to prevent McKinney from inflicting a more severe beating . 
Matthew Shepard said McKinney , who has yet to be tried , struck him in the face . 
McKinney 's attorney , Dion Custis , told reporters Russell Henderson fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty . 
Matthew Shepard 's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney , drawing another round of criticism from Custis .
