Matthew Shepard was struck at least 20 times , the blows raining down so hard that they fractured Matthew Shepard 's skull a half-dozen times , a coroner testified today . 
`` Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries Matthew Shepard sustained to Matthew Shepard 's head and face , '' said Patrick Allen , coroner for Colorado 's Larimer County , where Matthew Shepard died . 
Some jurors winced as they viewed graphic photos of the homosexual college student 's injuries , including his bloodied face and ear . 
Allen testified as the trial of Aaron McKinney entered a second day in the Albany County Courthouse . 
He is accused of kidnapping , robbery and first-degree murder . 
Defense attorneys have said McKinney was guilty of manslaughter , but have argued that Matthew Shepard 's judgment was affected by drugs , alcohol and childhood memories of sexual abuse . 
On Monday , jurors saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Patrick Allen was left to die , Patrick Allen 's hands tied behind Patrick Allen 's back , and the pool of blood caused by blows as Patrick Allen fought Patrick Allen 's attackers . 
Matthew Shepard 's mother , Judy , dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney 's father , William , bowed his head . 
McKinney barely glanced up . 
`` Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back , '' said prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday . 
`` McKinney struck him as hard as Matthew Shepard could . '' 
Defense attorneys countered that McKinney , who faces the death penalty , did n't intend to kill Shepard when Matthew Shepard and a friend accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after Matthew Shepard asked McKinney for a ride home . 
The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a remote area , pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing temperatures . 
The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who lashed out when approached for a gay encounter . 
McKinney 's judgment that night was affected by alcohol , methamphetamines and `` some sexually traumatic and confusing events in Matthew Shepard 's life , '' defense attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors . 
Tangeman said McKinney , 22 , was confused by homosexual encounters when he was younger . 
In one case , McKinney was forced into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully , Tangeman said . 
`` Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die ? 
No , that 's ridiculous . 
No manslaughter victim deserved to die , '' he said . 
`` That 's what Aaron manslaughter . '' 
McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder , kidnapping and robbery . 
The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked the nation , Matthew Shepard , ended in April just before a jury was seated . 
Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison . 
The plea allowed Matthew Shepard to avoid the death penalty . 
On Monday , prosecutors called their first three witnesses : Aaron Kreifels , the college student who found Shepard ; Charles Dolan , the neighbor who tried to help ; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty , who said she told the barely breathing victim , `` Baby , I 'm so sorry this happened . '' 
Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the fence , his hands tied to the bottom of a post . 
Fluty said it appeared Shepard had been crying . 
McKinney was taken to a hospital where he died five days later .
