Aaron McKinney , accused of the fatal beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard , pulled out a gun and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked , a teen-ager testified Tuesday . 
Aaron McKinney , 19 , said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano Morales III when McKinney went to his truck , pulled out a gun and hit Morales from behind . 
`` I heard a thud . 
It was the most sickening thing I ever heard in my life , '' said Matthew Shepard , who added Matthew Shepard struck McKinney with a thick stick . 
Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard 's beating . 
McKinney is charged with murder , kidnapping and robbery . 
If convicted , Aaron McKinney faces the death penalty . 
During the first full day of testimony , jurors also heard from the coroner who examined Shepard 's body , a bartender and Morales , who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker . 
McKinney 's co-defendant , Matthew Shepard , pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison . 
Prosecutors say McKinney and Matthew Shepard kidnapped Emiliano Morales III and took him to a remote area near Laramie on Oct. 7 , 1998 and lashed him to a fence , where they robbed him of $ 20 . 
Emiliano Morales III was beaten into a coma . 
He died five days later .
