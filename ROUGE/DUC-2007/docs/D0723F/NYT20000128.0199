With one arm around each of the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez , Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Friday reassured them that American law is on their side and predicted their grandson will be returned to Dianne Feinstein 's father in Cuba . 
After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana , Feinstein described them as `` heartbroken '' and `` sobbing '' and said she would do `` whatever I can '' to protect their rights . 
`` I have just spent some time with two women who were very intimidated , very fearful and very concerned , '' Feinstein , D-Calif. , said outside Elian Gonzalez 's Senate office . 
`` Grandmothers should not have to go through this and politics should not enter into it , '' she said . 
`` I believe that justice is going to find its way . 
I just hope it 's soon because politics and political movements should n't use children to meet their priorities . '' 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the American relatives of Elian Gonzalez , 6 , to return the boy to Mariela Quintana 's father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , in Cuba . 
Elian Gonzalez , who was 5 at the time , was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat carrying him to the United States capsized , killing Elian Gonzalez 's mother , her boyfriend and nine other people . 
Meanwhile Friday , the Florida nun whose Miami Beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers abruptly threw off her impartiality and came out in favor of keeping the boy in the United States . 
Following a meeting with members of Congress in Washington , Dominican Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said : `` The child has been in the torment of the seas and now Dianne Feinstein 's been in the torment of political agendas . 
Somehow we must find for him calm seas , at least for a while . '' 
O'Laughlin also met with Attorney General Jane Reno in hopes of persuading her to withdraw the INS order to send the boy back to Cuba . 
But Reno , who oversees the immigration agency , refused to budge . 
`` I continue to believe , based on all the information available to me , his father , '' Reno said in a statement released after the meeting.The grandmothers spent a third day Friday meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill . 
Besides Feinstein , the women met with Sen. Arlen Specter , R-Pa. , and Reps. Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , and George R. Nethercutt Jr. , R-Wash . 
Feinstein said Elian Gonzalez told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and immigration policies are on their side. `` that includes the right of a father to have a son back . '' 
Feinstein called congressional efforts to grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship so he can remain with his Florida relatives are `` terrible . '' 
Gonzalez 's relatives in Florida are fighting to prevent Elian Gonzalez 's return to Cuba , arguing that it was the wish of Elian Gonzalez 's mother for the boy to live in the United States . 
Feinstein , however , said `` a gold chain , a baseball cap , a trip to Disney Land and American razzle-dazzle '' are confusing the 6-year-old boy . 
She added that if the Cuban boy returns home and the father decides to bring Elian back to the United States `` on Elian Gonzalez 's own volition , that 's another story . ''
