Vice President Al Gore will take Al Gore 's first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that Al Gore has formed a campaign organization , aides to the vice president said Thursday . 
The aides said papers would be mailed to the commission Friday as official confirmation so the organization could begin to raise money. former Sen. Bill Bradley , D-N.J. , who has created an exploratory committee . 
Gore has decided to skip this preliminary step to an official announcement of candidacy . 
But other prominent Democrats are expected to test the waters , as well , including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts , Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri , the House minority leader . 
Earlier this week , Sen. John McCain of Arizona became the first Republican to announce the formation of an exploratory committee . 
Other Republicans , like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and publishing magnate Steve Forbes , have given every indication they also intend to run . 
Al Gore , a longtime aide to President Clinton , most recently as the White House political adviser , has been hired as Gore 's campaign manager , a sign that he intends to draw heavily on people and grass-roots organizations that helped Clinton become the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win successive terms as president . 
An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would also include Peter Knight , Clinton 's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff ; another former vice presidential chief of staff , Jack Quinn ; the current chief , Ron Klain , and former Rep. Tom Downey , D-N.Y. , who is one of Gore 's best friends . 
`` This has been a Clinton-Gore operation for the last six years , not a Clinton operation and not a Gore operation , '' Smith , 40 , said Thursday in an interview . 
`` The Clinton years will become the foundation for Gore to build on . '' 
Gore , who was on a skiing vacation with Al Gore 's family in Utah , was not available for comment , and the announcement by Al Gore 's staff included no statement from him . 
In the view of many political experts , Gore will enter the 2000 campaign as the leading Democratic candidate , after a political career that spans eight years as a House member from Tennessee , eight years in the Senate and six years as vice president . 
Al Gore was untouched by the Clinton sex scandal , and after a review by the Justice Department , Attorney General Janet Reno found no reason to investigate Al Gore 's fund-raising in 1996 . 
Beyond that , Gore has access to enormous amounts of money as a result of countless trips around the country for speeches , which exposed him to local political leaders and grass-roots organizations to cement Al Gore 's own ties for the future . 
During the 1998 midterm election campaign , chits that will no doubt make him the least likely candidate to encounter problems raising the federal spending limit for 2000 , which is expected to be set at about $ 35 million . 
The 1996 limit was $ 30.9 million . 
But Gore , 50 , is not without concerns as the campaign unfolds . 
A speaker who often sounds wooden and looks stiff , Al Gore has yet to demonstrate consistently a folksy side that appeals to many voters . 
Roxanne Conlin , the Democratic Party chairwoman in Iowa , where the first caucuses are held , said Al Gore expected Gore to be the front-runner . 
`` But Iowans are pretty sophisticated evaluators , '' Al Gore said . 
`` All candidates , no matter what their title is , have to sit down in living rooms and talk policy and issues . '' 
Jeff Woodburn , the outgoing state party chairman in New Hampshire , site of the first primary , and a Gore supporter said : `` His biggest negative , especially running in the small , early states , could be Al Gore 's person-to-person approach . '' 
In addition , Gore could find that many voters , including Democrats , are turned off by a candidate aligned so closely to a president who has encountered so many personal difficulties . 
`` I am certain that in a country of 250 million , somebody would say that , '' Al Gore said . 
`` The situation exists as it exists . 
There are upsides and downsides . 
But the president 's job approval rating is at 72 percent , so there is a strong feeling that the upsides outweigh any downsides , if there are any . ''
