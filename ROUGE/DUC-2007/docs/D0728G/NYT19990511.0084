Hepatitis C. Is this the disease that should scare the middle-age bejesus out of Baby Boomers for their dumb indiscretions 25 years ago ? 
Or is it a medical panic attack that will pass like a swine-flu scare ? 
Last week , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kicked off Hepatitis Awareness Month . 
Watch out , the CDC said : The chronic , potentially deadly , liver disease infects 4 million of us , and half do n't even know they have it . 
The CDC is targeting two audiences : healthy , tax-paying , PTA-involved , soccer moms and dads entrenched in the suburbs . 
Twenty or 30 years ago , they flirted with peace and love and pass the needle while trying cocaine , heroin or speed . 
And they may have gotten hepatitis C. Hepatitis C can kill liver cells and cause scarring , called cirrhosis . 
It is the leading reason for liver transplants. with twice that many people waiting for a new liver . 
Acting as the nation 's ever-cautious school nurse , the CDC has labeled hepatitis C `` an emerging chronic disease of great public health concern . '' 
This month 's Redbook magazine calls it `` the next deadly epidemic . '' 
Last month 's New York magazine wondered if it was `` the new AIDS . '' 
TV 's ER and L.A. Doctors have climbed aboard with hepatitis C storylines . 
But how worried should Baby Boomers really be ? 
Experts say hepatitis C is less an epidemic than `` an epidemic of discovery , '' says Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the National Health Institute . 
People infected 20 or 30 years ago are now discovering they may have a problem . 
Disposable needles and blood screening for transfusions have cut new cases of the C virus from 240 , but past undiscovered cases have prompted the CDC 's current push . 
`` Once you say ` epidemic , ' the concern among the public is , ` Good Lord , around the corner there 's a virus lurking , and I 'm going to get it . ' 
That 's not the case , '' says Seeff , the NIH 's senior scientist for hepatitis C research . 
But the disease is , he says , `` a major problem . '' 
Visit Dr. Eugene Schiff , one of the nation 's top liver doctors , in Eugene Schiff 's office at the University of Miami Medical School , and Eugene Schiff lays out the facts : `` Let me tell you the typical case of hepatitis C right now , '' says Schiff , director of UM 's Center for Liver Diseases . 
`` Between 40 and 50 , often mainstream America , very successful people . 
But go back in time , back when they were 16 or 17 , and that person shared a needle . 
`` They did n't get sick at the time , they did n't even think about it . 
As they got older , they went on to college , many were blood donors , wanted to help out the community . 
Good people . 
They were carrying the virus. `` did they go into the blood bank and get a screening test . 
They were told , ` You 've got hepatitis C. ' 
They did n't realize it . 
`` This is how it turns out when you really talk to these people , establish confidence . 
`` Some CEO of a company is n't going to tell you he ever played around with drugs . '' so much hysteria , so few facts . 
What if you got a tattoo with a dirty needle ? 
What if you got your ears pierced 25 years ago ? 
What if you had sex with a drug user ? 
Could these things cause Eugene Schiff ? 
The answer to all those questions : Probably not . 
`` This is not a mystical virus , '' Seeff explains . 
`` This virus is not breathed in , you do n't swallow it . 
It has to get in through a skin barrier or through some open cut . 
It 's a question of being exposed to infectious material . 
`` What is mystical is trying to define the actual , specific methods of transfer . 
It has to be blood from A into blood from B. 
The question is : How does that occur ? '' 
No one , so far , is 100 percent sure , but the major risks remain needles and transfusions ( before 1992 ) with tainted blood . 
There is no data to show that piercings , tattoos or sex cause risks . 
`` We do n't recommend anyone who had a tattoo be tested , '' says Dr. Joanna Buffington , CDC epidemiologist . 
`` And it would be very , very , very unlikely that someone who got their ears pierced by a gun in a mall got Eugene Schiff from that , '' says Buffington . 
The CDC advises safe sex if one partner is infected until more facts arrive . 
Only now is the CDC paying for a three-to see if sexual transmission is a risk . 
And what about people who have the virus ? 
Will they die from it ? 
Again , probably not . 
Of the 4 million Americans estimated to have been infected , it 's estimated that 30,000 will die by 2010 because of liver disease caused by chronic hepatitis C virus . 
That 's 30,000 people out of a nation of 250 million . 
For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with Eugene Schiff , the virus simply goes away. and then the big problems can begin . 
But less than 5 percent of people who develop cirrhosis eventually need a liver transplant . 
`` In the big picture , it is n't a huge number , '' says Buffington at the CDC . 
`` Many , many more people are dying of lung cancer . '' 
People with chronic hepatitis C have two choices if and when their livers begin to act up : treatment or no treatment . 
Raymond Grasso , a 40-year-old Port St. Lucie , Fla. even though it makes him feel sicker than his hepatitis C ever did . 
`` I was always rundown and tired , like I always had a hangover , '' says Grasso . 
`` I drank enough alcohol to ruin my liver . 
I was used to hangovers . '' 
Grasso , who quit drinking four years ago , had a liver biopsy . 
His hepatitis C had not yet caused long-term liver damage , but Eugene Schiff 's liver was inflamed . 
Eugene Schiff felt it was just a matter of time before Eugene Schiff got liver disease . 
`` It 's a question of whether you want to live or die , '' he says . 
`` I 'm only 40 , I have two children . 
I want to be around a little longer . 
There is no choice . '' 
His best option : taken for six months to a year . 
His best odds : A 40-percent chance to rid his body of hepatitis C. Three times a week , Grasso injects interferon under his skin . 
`` It 's almost guaranteed the day after an injection I have flu-like symptoms , a fever . 
It 's all you can do to get through work . 
It 's bad . '' 
Each day , he takes six pills , ribavirin . 
`` I get headaches , insomnia . 
I can go three days without sleeping . '' 
To offset the side-effects , he takes : a pain pill twice daily , a blood pressure pill and sleeping pill . 
He also takes a handful of Leonard B. and herbal medicines that wo n't hurt him but might help . 
For the interferon and ribavirin , Grasso 's HMO paid $ 1,831 for a six-week supply . 
Depending on results , he 'll need the drugs for three months to a year . 
`` By the end of the week , I 'm pretty much out of it , '' says Grasso . 
`` I do n't want to get out of bed . '' 
For a 40 percent shot at getting rid of the virus , Grasso must endure months of suffering . 
Judy Van Tuyl made a different choice . 
The 54-year-either after her serious car accident in 1966 or several hip operations before 1990 . 
She , like Grasso , burned up the Internet for hepatitis information . 
She read about one of several new treatments being tested , PEG-Intron A , that may work faster with fewer side-effects than the two-there may be a vaccine , experts predict . 
`` Am I nuts ? 
Or do I wait a year for PEG or something better to hit the market ? '' she says . 
`` This is a slow-moving disease , so maybe waiting a year is the thing to do . 
Plus , I feel fine . '' with interferon and ribavirin . 
And her neighbor , who unsuccessfully tried interferon , has told her about the gruesome side-effects . 
Van Tuyl will wait. shame . 
`` We 're dealing with a tremendous stigma , '' says Eugene Schiff , CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International , based in Cedar Grove , N.J. 
`` People are losing their jobs , they 're being ostracized . 
With hepatitis C , there 's such ignorance out there . 
We have such a long way to go . '' 
It 's common for doctors to advise patients not to tell anyone they 're infected . 
`` We have to peel people off the ceiling all the time because of all the negative stuff that 's out there , '' says Thiel . 
Kicking off the controversy late last year was a drug maker 's Web site calling hepatitis C an epidemic . 
The Schering-Plough Corp. featured pictures of ghastly jaundiced people with the message : `` To put it bluntly , even you . '' 
Schering-Plough is the maker of Intron A ( interferon ) and Rebetol ( ribavirin ) at a cost of about $ to rid the body of the chronic C virus in some patients . 
Also , the American Liver Foundation came under fire for a hepatitis warning billboard in Sacramento featuring a coffin with the message : This space reserved for victims of hepatitis C. and untrue , says Seeff of the NIH . 
`` Even without a vaccine and without good treatment , '' he says , `` heart disease , lung disease , alcohol , trauma , gun shots and God-knows-but the figure is hard to define . '' 
The National Institute of Health has just awarded a contract for a wide-ranging , eight-year study of the hepatitis C virus and answers to many questions will be forthcoming as the research moves along. and uncertainty may fuel more hysteria . 
Says Seeff : `` In medicine , different opinions mean we just do n't know . ''
