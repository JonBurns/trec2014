Randy Weaver will be in the co-pilot 's seat of Bo Gritz ' Cessna today when it touches down in Andrews , N. C.will undertake their mission to hopefully escort Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph out of the mountains and down a safe corridor through the federal justice system . 
Weaver , of the infamous Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho , knows all too well what Rudolph is up against . 
A missed court date in 1991 over a minor weapons charge led to an 18-month high-tech reconnaissance mission by federal agents that on Aug. 21 , 1992 , was whipped into chaos after an agent shot one of Weaver 's barking dogs that was blowing their camouflaged cover . 
The standoff ended 11 days later , with Weaver wounded and Randy Weaver 's wife and son dead . 
Never again do federal agents want another Ruby Ridge . 
They have said that once they find Rudolph 's hiding place , it could take weeks , even months to negotiate him out . 
Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force say they know Rudolph is armed with long guns . 
Investigators said tests conducted at the U.S. that Rudolph has driven since the Jan. 29 bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in Birmingham . 
Rudolph is wanted for questioning in connection with the deadly July 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park , January 1997 double-blast at an Atlanta-area abortion clinic and a February 1997 blast at a gay Atlanta nightclub . 
A $ 1 million dollar reward on his head has made information leading to Rudolph 's arrest a hot commodity for bounty hunters . 
His mother , Pat Rudolph , has released statements of concern for her son 's life and the safety of the lawmen tracking him . 
Weaver will appeal to Mrs. Rudolph , who lives in Florida but is currently in North Carolina , that Rudolph 's son should give himself up , said Vicci Gritz , the former soldier 's daughter-in-law . 
`` They ( federal agents ) feel like she might have some kind of contact with him somehow , '' Randy Weaver said . 
`` Randy will reason with and son 's so and son can reason with him . '' 
Federal officials had no comment about the claim that Pat Rudolph talks to and son 's son , probably by telephone . 
`` When they searched Eric Rudolph 's home , Rudolph had some of our training videos , '' Andrews said . 
`` We have not had any contact with him . '' 
Randy Weaver , 59 , who has a daily radio show that can be picked up on shortwave , plans to muster at least 100 volunteers to go into the mountains this weekend . 
Any participants must sign a waiver of the reward , because Randy Weaver has promised it to Rudolph 's mother to use for his defense . 
That tactic had not been embraced by the FBI Wednesday , and son said . 
But that 's all Gritz may have to offer Rudolph , who could face the death penalty . 
`` I do n't think these guys are going to be effective , '' said retired FBI Agent Robert Ressler , one of the original and most experienced profilers of criminals. `` ( Gritz ) can not trust the government unless Rudolph gets something in writing . 
Today they may say something and tomorrow say another , depending on which way the political winds are blowing . '' 
Doug Jones , U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama , said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and the death penalty . 
`` Under Justice Department guidelines , we ca n't make that decision until he 's in custody and indicted , '' Jones said . 
`` It 's my understanding that that decision will be made in Washington . 
There will be a recommendation from our office , but the ultimate decision will be left in the hands of the ( U.S . ) attorney general . '' 
Ressler said death by lethal injection will never deter some of today 's new brand of terrorists . 
`` Using the death penalty to prevent acts of terrorism is a joke , '' he said . 
`` If you are mission oriented and willing to die for the cause ....the death penalty is nothing more than a political football . '' 
Jack Killorin , head of the Atlanta ATF office has said investigators believe Rudolph is on an unfinished mission . 
Investigators said that might include hurting a group of agents or even media workers . 
Investigators have said all along that Rudolph was hiding in the Nantahala where Randy Weaver spent Randy Weaver 's adolescence honing Randy Weaver 's skills in the woods . 
It 's where Randy Weaver is the most comfortable . 
A month ago , Rudolph proved their theory correct when Randy Weaver emerged in search of food and provisions from an elderly health store food owner . 
Killorin has said it was not Rudolph 's intention to run away or leave the country . 
His intentions , investigators said they believe , are to finish the job he started . 
`` If his ultimate plan is to finish his mission , he 's a very dangerous man , '' Ressler said . 
`` Rather than negotiate , I think it 's imperative to nail him and get him under control . ''
