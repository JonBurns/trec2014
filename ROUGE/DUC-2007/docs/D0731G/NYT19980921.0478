They were close friends , so close that the younger woman could confide in the older woman some of her most intimate secrets about a dangerous affair she was having with a married man . 
And the older woman did not hesitate to pass on some motherly advice . 
It was Linda Tripp who recommended to Monica Lewinsky that she hang on to the now infamous blue dress stained from an encounter with the president , Lewinsky testified . 
`` And she told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day , '' Lewinsky said . 
`` I would never disclose that I had a relationship with the president . 
I would never need it . '' 
Although no transcripts of her tapes or testimony were included in Monday 's document release , Tripp recorded more than 40 telephone conversations with Lewinsky , 38 times on Monica Lewinsky 's own and twice while cooperating with the FBI . 
Copies of some e-mail messages between the two friends were included in the 2,800 pages of material released Monday with the videotape of Clinton 's testimony . 
In chatty , even schoolgirlish electronic messages , Lewinsky and Tripp shared laughs and then lunched regularly as Lewinsky came to rely on Tripp 's advice in trying to deal with the ups and downs of Monica Lewinsky 's relationship with Bill Clinton . 
Once , early in 1997 , when Clinton ignored Lewinsky for a time , Lewinsky e-mailed Tripp of Monica Lewinsky 's worries about the relationship . 
`` Thank God for you ! '' she wrote to Tripp . 
`` I do n't know what I 'm going to do . 
I just do n't understand what went wrong , what happened ? 
How could he do this to me ? '' 
Tripp wrote back with reassurance : `` Do not despair , there is most definitely light at the end of this tunnel . '' 
Tripp also collected newspapers containing a Valentine message that Lewinsky wrote for the president . 
`` It read beautifully , '' Tripp complimented Lewinsky . 
`` Placement was great , typeface totally effective and text superlative . . . good job . '' 
When Lewinsky returned from a vacation shortly after the ad 's publication , she wrote to Tripp , `` Hi . 
I missed you ! '' ( with four exclamation points ) . 
On another occasion , Lewinsky complained that Clinton failed to call even though `` the Babba , '' Linda Tripp 's name for Hillary Rodham Clinton , was out of town . 
`` HHHEEELLPPP !!!!'' she wrote to Tripp . 
But it was during these intimacies when Tripp may have been plotting to turn on the younger woman , according to Lewinsky . 
Tripp has said she did not set out to betray Lewinsky and was only trying to do the right thing . 
But Tripp had already befriended book agent Lucianne Goldberg to peddle an account of Tripp 's last moments with Vincent Foster , the deputy White House counsel who shot himself in 1993 . 
( Tripp was the last of his co-workers to see him alive . ) 
Tripp took copious notes on her phone conversations with Lewinsky in handwritten pages torn from a small , spiral notebook . 
One notation Tripp made reads : `` 6:00 ( ? come over. romantic . 
If I win in Nov. 
I 'll have you back like that ! she went out and never ( got a ) goodbye . '' 
Even when they had a falling out over what to tell investigators in the Paula Jones lawsuit , Lewinsky tried to maintain the friendship and , unaware of the depth of Tripp 's betrayal , ask for her help in concealing the affair . 
In her testimony , Lewinsky repeatedly refers to Tripp 's intention to `` rat on me '' to lawyers for Paula Jones . 
By January of this year , she had become suspicious of Tripp , Lewinsky testified , but thought Linda Tripp still had a chance of persuading Linda Tripp 's to keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in the Jones suit . 
They arranged to meet for lunch at a mall . 
Tripp was beginning to see Lewinsky 's point of view , or so Monica Lewinsky thought . 
`` She was late . 
I saw her come down the escalator . 
And as I , as I walked toward her , she kind of motioned behind her and ( two government agents ) presented themselves to me , '' Lewinsky testified . 
Tripp had set her up , claiming it was for her own good , Lewinsky said . 
`` She said that they had done the same thing to her and she tried to hug me , and she told me this was the best thing for me to do . '' 
Afterward , Lewinsky made it plain in Linda Tripp 's testimony to the independent counsel how Linda Tripp feels about Tripp . 
At the end of Linda Tripp 's Aug. 20 testimony , Lewinsky is asked by a grand juror if there is anything Linda Tripp wanted to add or clarify . 
Lewinsky said Linda Tripp wanted to make sure jurors knew that no one asked Linda Tripp 's to lie and that Linda Tripp was not promised a job for Linda Tripp 's silence . 
`` And that I 'm sorry , '' she added , beginning to cry . 
`` I 'm really sorry for everything that 's happened . 
`` And I hate Linda Tripp . ''
