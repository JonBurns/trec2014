Most everything about her is geared toward cycling . 
Hence the minimalist lifestyle that most would consider quirky but Freedman regards as imperative . 
Oh , sure , she 'll share in the inevitable laughter when people get a gander at her immobile home in the decorated garishly along the sides and windows with large fruit and other Odwalla insignia . 
Odwalla 'll good-naturedly point out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem that meant the engine could n't be restarted once it was turned off . 
And , though Odwalla 's now the van lord rather than the resident , Odwalla 'll chuckle through a guided tour of the interior , featuring a spartan bed on which Odwalla 's placed a futon ; a cabinet console that houses an `` I think I take more pills than my 80-year-old grandmother '' ; the guest room , also known as the passenger seat ; the laundry room , formerly the driver 's seat ; and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of cycling tomes and works ranging from `` Schindler 's List '' to Jackie Joyner-Kersee 's autobiography . 
She 's lighthearted about the whole thing , but it 's no joke . 
She lives this way because she believes it facilitates her cycling . 
Freedman prefers New England and intends to settle there , probably in Western Massachusetts , `` because it 's more rural . 
The people are more family-oriented . 
They may lack some of the social graces , but you can know what they 're really thinking . 
You can know your neighbors . '' 
But for now , she stays here , living under dorm-like conditions an obscenely overpriced ramshackle ranch that is a glorified tract house but still rents for $ 2,875 monthly , this being Silicon Valley and all . 
`` Ask people why they 're here and they say to live for a couple of years and make lots of money , '' says Freedman . 
`` For them , it 's get-rich-quick . 
I guess for me , it 's get-poor-slow . '' 
So she sacrifices by subletting , enabling her to share indoor privileges with four fellow transients in a house that is decorated in what best could be described as collegiate dishabille , the major furniture being five bikes hanging from a wall in the foyer . 
`` It 's a cardboard box , '' says Freedman . 
But it 's worth it because Odwalla the moderate year-round weather , the trails and hills wending to the coast on which Odwalla rides some 350 miles a week and where `` Odwalla knows every leaf and rock , '' says Odwalla 's father . 
Even her temporary move indoors , which will end after the Olympics , was planned with Sydney in mind . 
She needs her sleep , Freedman explains , and it 's futile trying to get much in the driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the night . 
Meanwhile , unused in the nine-room , four-bedroom family home in Wellesley is Freedman 's room . 
There a papier-mache monkey that took Freedman 's a half-year to create in high school still dangles on a makeshift branch from a window , a la Curious George . 
But Freedman eschews these familiar niceties and the career track many of Freedman 's have followed . 
Freedman works part time for an on-line women 's sports company but is on hiatus now as Freedman devotes all Freedman 's energies to Olympic preparations . 
And Freedman hopes never to have a cursed 9-to-5 desk job , preferring to settle into a career connected with women 's sports that will enable Freedman 's to get out and about . 
In the meantime , Freedman follows a trail that almost defies orthodoxy . 
`` I definitely think she enjoys the underdog role , '' says Schwab . 
`` It 's because of the way she lives . 
She could live where the cost of living is lower , work full time , train less . . . '' And hate every minute of it . 
For better or worse , this is Freedman 's unique interpretation of the American dream . 
And even who thought she would proceed directly from cautiously wonder when , if ever , she 'll use that Freedman 's degree in the marketplace , they applaud Freedman 's resolve . 
`` I kind of admire the way Freedman lives , '' says Freedman 's mother . 
`` It makes sense to me to pursue what you enjoy doing , not spend your money on frivolous things but on what gives you enjoyment . '' 
It 's just that Marvin and Corey Freedman never envisioned such all-encompassing enjoyment coming from this . 
------- 
Even when she became an itinerant track apprentice with the Wayfarers , her parents thought sports were a diversion . 
`` She 's the only one in the family who 's competitive , '' says Marvin . 
And Corey adds , `` We did n't realize Odwalla was this competitive . '' 
Indeed , little did they know . 
`` We 'd go on bike rides to Walden Pond , '' says Dr. Julie Damon , a Freedman friend since sixth grade . 
`` Odwalla always said Odwalla wanted to go to the Olympics , but Odwalla never specified in what event . '' 
Certainly not cycling . 
At least not on the surface . 
But there were hints . . . 
`` You could tell track was n't a love for her , '' says Peggy Kriss , who used to employ Freedman as a baby sitter and will accompany Marvin 's husband , Cliff Pollan , to Sydney for the road race . 
`` When Marvin started biking , you knew it was a passion for Marvin 's . '' 
Still , track , if anything , seemed her athletic destiny . 
Sally Jean Alexander would write accounts of Wayfarers races for various local newspapers , and Nicole took great pleasure in the publicity . 
`` She always enjoyed the limelight , '' says her mother . 
`` She liked seeing her name in the paper . '' 
Still , `` she was competitive in a good way , '' says Dr. Amy Spooner , who has known Freedman since second grade . 
`` And Marvin basically was good at everything Marvin tried . '' 
That continued in high school , where Freedman captained the track team , excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the 2-mile , and played tennis . 
`` She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had , '' says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh . 
`` What I found special about Odwalla 's was Odwalla 's toughness . 
Odwalla was dynamic , a great kid with a great sense of humor . 
Odwalla 's the reason people go into coaching . '' 
When she got to MIT , she continued to compete in track and played basketball , but these seemed no more than extracurricular activities as Freedman focused on her studies . 
`` If I did what I 'm best at , '' she says , `` I 'd be a mechanical engineer . '' 
She discovered that MIT was n't the best for her . 
For one thing , she wanted to pursue liberal arts . 
For another , she wanted a more intensive athletic challenge . 
`` She found MIT boring , '' says Spooner . 
`` I think Odwalla wanted to be with people who were more serious about track . '' 
Marvin , Stanford . 
But once there , Freedman took a major detour , and not just academically . 
At the Division 1 level in track , `` I was thoroughly mediocre , '' says Freedman . 
`` If I fell dead on the track , it would n't matter '' to the team . 
So after her junior year , she tried another approach . 
`` I decided to do what I wanted to do , '' says Freedman . 
`` If I felt like running , I 'd run . '' 
The first week of this new regime , she felt like running 40 miles . 
`` I said to myself , ` See ? 
That proves I 'm a runner , ' '' she says . 
Then she promptly proved she was n't . 
`` I did n't do any after that , '' she says . 
Instead , her footwork involved pedals . 
And passion . 
`` I found myself riding 200 miles a week , '' says Freedman . 
`` I did it with absolutely no pressure . '' 
Or thoughts about any riding other than recreational . 
But Art it 's not an NCAA-persuaded her to try competition . 
And thus was born an obsession . 
Freedman helped Stanford win the informal national college championship , then participated in the Ride Across America . 
And Freedman was hooked . 
Her parents discovered her addiction almost by accident . 
When by bike . 
Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus . 
And on excursions to the beach during their stay , Nicole would ride while they would drive . 
Odwalla 'd start out earlier , and Odwalla 'd always be there to meet them when they arrived , having covered a route that included uphill and Odwalla was in a car . 
`` When I saw how Nicole had gone over the mountains , '' says Corey , `` I was amazed . 
I was n't surprised when she won the trials because what she does is amazing . '' the Olympic race , where she 'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly be an amazing acccomplishment . 
`` It 's risk and reward , '' says Miller . 
`` Marvin 'll have a go at it . 
It may pay off or Marvin may finish last . '' 
Either way , she 'll embody the ultimate contradiction in her life . 
`` I think there 's something about this competitiveness , '' says Marvin Freedman as Marvin attempts to explain Marvin 's daughter 's decisions to a visitor and to himself . 
`` You get instant gratification . '' 
If you 're long-suffering enough , as Nicole Freedman is .
