Just after dusk on Friday , John F. Kennedy Jr. , hobbled by a broken foot , limped to the flight line of a small airport in Fairfield , N.J. to inspect Kennedy Jr. 's Piper Saratoga HP airplane . 
Satisfied with the plane 's condition , Kennedy eased himself into the left pilot 's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight to an airport near John F. 's late mother 's homestead on Martha's Vineyard . 
His wife , Carolyn Bessette Kennedy , and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy 's older sister , Lauren Bessette , climbed aboard the six-seat plane . 
The engine turned . 
The instruments came to life . 
Within minutes , the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed into the hazy evening sky . 
No one has seen it since . 
Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine , the series of flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan , choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions , and piloting an have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah , Mass. 
The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m. Friday , about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport . 
Sunday , searchers recovered bits of the aircraft 's fuselage and interior ; on Saturday , they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette 's business cards attached . 
While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane 's equipment , officials hope John F. was familiar with at least one : the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997 . 
`` It was an easy on-off switch , '' said Munir Hussein , its second owner , who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $ 300,000 . 
`` I used it several times and it worked perfectly . '' 
Investigators say the recorder , which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit , can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah , known as Gay Head . 
The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy 's plane the aircraft is recovered . 
But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end , according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England . 
Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday , but was delayed when John F. 's sister-in-law could n't leave work early enough , and John F. encountered traffic coming out of New York , the Associated Press quoted a friend as saying . 
But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when John F. did . 
After takeoff , Kennedy cruised eastward , flying at 5,500 feet , a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules , procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see . 
As he flew through gathering darkness , only a few stars emerged through the haze , and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky. shook their heads as his plane lifted off . 
They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone , but that John F. was n't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight . 
In fact , Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being , John F. 'd rather fly with a copilot because John F. 's broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane 's rudder . 
Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane . 
But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight plan , and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving or that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was piloting the airplane . 
Warren Morningstar , a private pilot and spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association , said it was not unusual for a pilot to fly without filing a plan . 
Still , Morningstar said , `` a flight plan is really an insurance policy , not an air traffic control document . '' 
`` Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue earlier ? '' he said . 
`` Yes , it probably would have . '' 
But for most of Kennedy 's flight , everything went smoothly . 
At 9:39 , nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey , Kennedy 's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent . 
Over the next 29 seconds , the plane dropped 700 feet . 
It then disappeared from all radar screens . 
Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy 's plane was overdue until sometime Saturday morning . 
The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was scheduled to leave at 10 p.m. Friday , and the airport 's runway lights were dimmed . 
To brighten them , an approaching pilot must tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the microphone five times in five seconds , or seven times in seven seconds to reach their maximum wattage . 
Until the plane 's sudden drop , the radar tapes from the FAA facility used to guide planes in and out of T.F. Green Airport airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight . 
`` We had a plot on him , we were able to determine which plane was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet , '' said Howard Barte , the controller 's union local president in Rhode Island . 
`` He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard , and then in the last few minutes John F. seemed to descend rather steeply for that airplane . 
The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact . 
`` It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that this happened , '' Barte said . 
`` Maybe in five more minutes John F. would have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun John F. 's descent , but this rate of descent was not normal . 
`` When you see something like this , you have to ask : Was there something wrong with the plane , or with the pilot ? 
Because that is all there is . ''
