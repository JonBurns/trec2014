<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In 1991 it started a classroom program "Teaching Tolerance" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The SPLC's most outstanding successes, however, have been in its civil lawsuits against hate groups.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Dees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Described as "wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders," the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>But despite these judgments the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance have survived.</a>
