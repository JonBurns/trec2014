<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Morris Dees is a co-founder and leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, located in Montgomery, Alabama.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It was founded to battle racial bias and has expanded its efforts by tracking hate crimes and the increasing spread of racist organizations across the US.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>"Teaching Tolerance" is a major program of the Center.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Under that program, a magazine promoting interracial and intercultural understanding goes to more than 400,000 teachers.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Other publications of the Center include the magazine "Intelligence Report" and pamphlets "Ten Ways to Fight Hate" and "Fighting Hate at School".</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Dees has determined that the civil courts are an effective forum in which to attack and destroy hate groups.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He has used the civil lawsuit like a "Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders".</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Some skeptics thought that Dees sought out victims of hate groups to profit from their tragedy.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, Dees does not charge the groups and the Center estimates that it collects only 2% on successful judgments.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Dees has a perfect record in the major lawsuits he has prosecuted.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Successful judgments include one for $21.5M against a South Carolina branch of the Ku Klux Klan for burning the Macedonia Baptist Church.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Others include $6.3M against Aryan Nation's leader Richard Butler and $7M against a Klan group that killed a black man in Mobile, Alabama.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The Center operates mostly on contributions that in the late 1990s have increased to around $100 Million annually.</a>
