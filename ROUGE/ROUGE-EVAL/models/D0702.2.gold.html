<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, students are encouraged to attend free performances, and improvements are continually made to music and art facilities in schools.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Officials there believe these efforts help to nurture civilized manners and moral conduct.</a>
