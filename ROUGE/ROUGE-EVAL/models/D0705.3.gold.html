<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, is a separatist group demanding the right to self-determination for Spain's three Basque provinces in the north to form an independent state in union with the three Basque regions in southwestern France.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the ETA campaign began in 1968, over 800 people have been killed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Spanish government has consistently refused to negotiate with the separatists.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The conflict is characterized by demonstrations by Basque separatists and sympathizers, violent clashes with police, firebombings, and assassinations of officials and militants on both sides.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In July 1996, the ETA announced a weeklong unilateral ceasefire.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It was rejected by the Spanish government, which urged its political parties not to negotiate unless the separatists agreed to surrender its weapons, confirm that it really wants peace, and renounce violence for good.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>At issue was the fate of over 500 ETA prisoners in remote areas of Spain and the release of a prison officer held by the ETA for over five months.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The uncompromising led to further demonstrations, bombings, and six slayings by June 1998, fueled by ETA's charge that the government was trying to snuff out the Basque language.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In November, the ETA and the government made direct contact for the first time since 1989 but only with acknowledgement that the two sides would have further contacts.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The government transferred some prisoners and considered paying damages to relatives of Basques killed by government squads.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>By late 2000, the death toll was 12 and progress seemed doomed.</a>
