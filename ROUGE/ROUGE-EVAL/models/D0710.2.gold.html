<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Greek Cypriot police arrested two Israeli men on suspicion of spying November 7, 1998 in Ziyi.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The two were found with electronic surveillance equipment and recordings of police or military conversations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Police revealed that the men telephoned an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv just before their arrest and there was an important military operation in the area at the time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>They'd visited Ziyi twice the month before.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Their previous visit coincided with a Greek Cypriot military exercise off the coast.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Speculation in the press suggested they might have been conducting a training exercise or supplying information regarding Cyprus' purchase of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Turkey.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Some speculated their arrest was meant as a warning to Israel not to provide military assistance to Turkey in its fight against Greek Cyprus.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Israel and Turkey had significantly increased military cooperation in recent years.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Eventually, Israel admitted the men were agents of its intelligence agency, Mossad, but assured they were not acting against Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A senior Mossad official was forced to resign.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The situation strained Israeli-Greek Cypriot relations.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>At their trial, the defense claimed the two were civil servants involved in anti-terrorist operations not aimed at Cyprus.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>However, the court found no evidence to substantiate the claim.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The two were sentenced to three years in prison on lesser charges.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>They were pardoned in August 1999 as a goodwill gesture.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In March 2000, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides was to visit Israel to cement Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by the scandal.</a>
