<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On November 5, 1998, Cypriot police arrested two Israeli men on suspicion of spying following a raid on their apartment in the coastal town of Zygi.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The apartment contained electronic equipment for monitoring military communications.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>According to the police, the pair stayed in Zygi in October during a large Greek-Cypriot military exercise nearby.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Someone remembered their October visit and notified authorities.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The Israeli government admitted the two suspects were agents of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some intelligence experts speculated they were spying for Turkey on orders from Mossad.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Both Israel and Turkey had an interest in gaining information about the planned deployment in Cyprus of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Israeli's Foreign Ministry claimed the two agents were not working for Turkey and were not acting against Cyprus.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The close military relation between Turkey and Israel was a continuing Cypriot concern.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Turkey occupied the northern third of Cyprus while Greek Cypriots controlled the south.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cyprus had no relations with Turkey and lukewarm relations with Israel.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In an effort to improve relations between the two countries, Israeli's President had visited Cyprus three days before the arrest of the two agents.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The arrest soured these relations.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>To dispel bad feelings, Israeli's Prime Minister visited Cyprus in December.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The two Israeli agents were sentenced to three years in prison in a plea bargain deal, with the prosecution dropping charges of conspiracy and espionage.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The Cypriot government pardoned the two after they served six month in jail as a goodwill gesture to the new Israeli government.</a>
