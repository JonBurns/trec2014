<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, pronouncing a death sentence against British author Salman Rushdie for his1988 novel The Satanic Verses.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Khomeini ruled the book blasphemous to Islam and exhorted all Moslems to execute the sentence.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For almost 10 years, Rushdie lived in safe houses around London, guarded around the clock.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He was persona non grata in his native India, the first country to ban his book.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The controversial problem hindered relations between Iran and European countries.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In 1996, the Iranian government began softening its stance on the edict, claiming it was a religious rather than executive decree, and that it never intended to carry it out.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Islamic hardliners and clerics in and out of Iran protested that the government didn't have the right to change a fatwa and called for Rushdie's death.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A private Iranian foundation raised its bounty on Rushdie from $2 million to $2.5, then $2.8 million.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A hard-line student group offered a 1 billion riyal ($333,000) reward.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Residents of an Iranian village offered land and carpets as bounty.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological students pledged a month's salary and said they were ready to execute the edict.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In September 1998, the Iranian government disassociated itself from the fatwa and any reward.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The EU welcomed the essential lifting of the death sentence.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A year later, Rushdie said his life had improved, though still not 100% normal.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Eleven years after its issue, Islamic hard-liners still claimed the fatwa to be in effect.</a>
