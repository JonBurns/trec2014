<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In February, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, a fatwa, pronouncing a death sentence on India-born, British novelist Salman Rushdie.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses" is believed by Moslems to defame Islam and therefore mark him for death.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Seven years later, the Iranian Government, under pressure from European countries, dropped the death sentence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>President Rafsanjani said that it "was never meant to be carried out".</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Eventually this led to the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Iran and the UK.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This announcement led Rushdie to believe that it constituted an end to the furtive life he had been leading under British police protection for several years.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He was finally able to appear in public and eventually was able to visit the land of his birth, India, where he had been unwelcome for several years.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Despite the Iranian Government's dropping of the death sentence, others in Iran believe that only Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has the authority to cancel the death sentence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Several groups, independent of the Iranian Government, began to offer bounties for the murder of Rushdie.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Khordad Foundation offered $2.5M for killing Rushdie.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A student group at the Association of Hezbollah University offered over $300K to kill Rushdie.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Residents of a village in northern Iran offered carpets and land to anyone who would get rid of Rushdie.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological students have pledged a month's salary for his murder.</a>
