<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While confronting reports that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear test in 1996, a Foreign Office spokesman denied the reports, stating "Pakistan has been in the vanguard...to advance the cause of non-proliferation" but "Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan...have fumbled because of India's negativism".</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After India's series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, 1998, the Pakistani Prime Minister commented "...the Indian actions rendered...instruments such as Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty...irrelevant".</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Many countries imposed sanctions on both countries.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Pakistan refused to sign the NPT on the basis that it was unfair with its double standards allowing some nations to maintain nuclear arsenals and denying that right to others.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A Foreign Office spokesman pointed out "treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties".</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In September 1998 Pakistan's Prime Minister agreed to unilaterally adhere to the CTBT but in 2000 Pakistan reasserted its determination to maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any aggression against it.</a>
