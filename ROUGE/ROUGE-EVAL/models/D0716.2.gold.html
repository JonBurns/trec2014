<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In 1996, Energy Resources Australia (ERA) requested approval for the Jabiluka uranium mine on the edge of the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>ERA's second uranium mine in the area would generate billions of US dollars in revenue and create 2,000 jobs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Opposition parties, conservationists and local Mirrar Aboriginal people opposed the mine despite ERA assurances that it wouldn't adversely affect the area.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After a protracted legal battle and amid continuing protests, ERA received approval and began mine construction in June 1998.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Police reported hundreds of arrests as protesters blockaded the site, firebombed an ERA office, and infiltrated an ERA general meeting.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Two aboriginal protestors won the 1999 Goldman Environmental Prize for having delayed the mine project.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A UNESCO World Heritage Bureau delegation visited the area in October 1998 and concluded the Jabiluka mine would pose a severe danger to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National Park.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The report recommended the Kakadu World Heritage Area be declared endangered.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Australia's Environmental Minister denounced the report as biased and unsubstantiated.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The bureau gave the government until April 15, 1999 to provide a comprehensive rebuttal.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Meanwhile, the government allowed work to continue, despite UNESCO's recommendation it be halted.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Australia's rebuttal cited errors of science, law and logic, and declared UNESCO's findings inconsistent with the fact that another nearby mine has operated for 20 years without adverse impact.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>While the conservative government continued to support the mine, opposition parties vowed to halt operations should they win upcoming elections.</a>
