<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the early part of this period, the unemployment rate for persons of working age reached 12.5%.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>France's economy during this period was very sluggish with the growth rate near zero.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>High public spending is a factor as are high labor costs, especially for unskilled labor.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Conditions did improve and France closed out the decade with its unemployment rate lowered to 10.6%.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The high unemployment rate led to protests and demonstrations by workers and included some violence.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Social disparity heightened, crime rates rose as did the rate of suicides.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The government did increase unemployment benefits and in some cases provide holiday bonuses to alleviate hardship caused by the situation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>One proposal was made to cut working hours for workers and then hire more employees but this generated little hope of success.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the long term, France should concentrate on achieving wage flexibility and reducing the cost of unskilled labor.</a>
