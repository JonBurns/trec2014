<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In 1998, Boeing was awarded a $1.6 billion research and development program contract to design, develop, test and integrate components for a NMD system.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Boeing was to design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and spaced-based satellites for missile launch detection and communication.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The system had an estimated cost of $60 billion.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Clinton administration envisioned a more modest land-based system, with a cost of $10.5 billion.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The initial proposed system of 100 interceptor missiles would protect the US from a limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>They said the system could be fooled by decoys or other countermeasures easily within reach of any country capable of launching a long-range ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead at the US.</a>
