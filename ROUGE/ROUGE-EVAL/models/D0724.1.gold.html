<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Obesity is a major health problem in the United States.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Statistics on the extent of obesity are varied but one fact is clear: the problem is getting worse rather than better.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some statistical studies either combine or confuse the obese and the overweight.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Reports from 1998-2000 showed 55-58% of the U.S. population either overweight or obese.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>58% of African-Americans were in the group with 54% of Latinos and 44% of whites.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Studies found 20-33% of adults and 15% of children obese and one study placed the figure for Americans as a whole at 17.9%.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Between 1991 and 1999 the obesity rate for Americans as a whole increased about 50% from 12% to 17.9%.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In 1991 only 4 states had a rating greater than 15% while in 1999 45 states reached that level.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The southeast U.S. increased 67.2% and Georgia led the nation with an increase of 101.8%. West Virginia had the highest rate of obesity at 22.9%.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The cause of obesity is a complicated combination of genetic and environmental factors.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>While genetic factors influence appetite and the weight-gaining effect of a given quantity of food, the basic causes of the problem are over- consumption of high-calorie food and lack of adequate exercise.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Specific examples of this mix are over-promotion and over-consumption of huge servings of fast food, lack of sidewalks and exercise facilities ad too much television.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>More generally, the cause is a culture of abundance and inactivity.</a>
