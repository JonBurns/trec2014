<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since at least 1997 Iran, a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and Non-Proliferation Treaty, has publicly disavowed plans to develop nuclear weapons, a claim bolstered by International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, even after India and Pakistan tested nuclear bombs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Kiev withdrew its turbines for a planned Russian-supplied nuclear power plant in Bushehr.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Iran and Russia called for a nuclear-weapons free zone in the Middle East, where only Israel has nuclear weapons.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Iran has military ties with nuclear weapons states India, Pakistan and China.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>China probably helped Pakistan build its atomic bombs, which Israel calls "Islamic Bombs".</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Iran called Pakistan's nuclear bomb Islam's deterrent against Israel.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Pakistan denies helping Iran with nuclear weapons.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In July 1998 Iran successfully tested a 1,300-kilometer North Korean "Rodong" missile (which Iran called "Shahab-3") capable of hitting all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Iran was expected to test a 2,000-kilometer "Shahab-4" ("Taepo Dong") missile by 1999.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Israel accused China and North Korea of helping Iran build nuclear weapons, and declared readiness to preemptively strike Iran, because Shahab-3 would be operational by 1999 and they believed Iran was developing atomic weapons just as fast.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Iran claimed Shahab-3 was for nonmilitary purposes, like launching satellites.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In January 2000 the US expressed new concern about Iran's possible ability to divert fissionable material from its planned nuclear power plants to make nuclear weapons and that Iran might develop a missile that could reach the US by 2010 or sooner.</a>
