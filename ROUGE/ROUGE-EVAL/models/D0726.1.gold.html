<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Gore began touring the country gathering support from diverse groups and talking to citizens one-on-one to overcome his reputation for stiffness.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He appointed women and blacks to his campaign staff to counter his reputation of operating with an inner circle of white males.</a>
