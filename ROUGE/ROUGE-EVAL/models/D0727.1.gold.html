<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On July 29, 1999 Newt Gingrich filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, Marianne, declaring the marriage "irretrievably broken".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Marianne filed a counterclaim asking a judge to freeze the couple's assets accusing Newt of transferring assets before filing for divorce.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Newt denied the charge but a confidential financial agreement pending a divorce settlement was reached on Sept. 10.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Marianne requested and a judge granted a videotaped deposition of a 33-year-old Congressional aide, Callista Bisek, with whom Newt was alleged to have had an affair.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Bisek appealed to another judge to overrule the decision.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Marianne then asked permission to depose Newt's close advisors and associates to get answers to questions that he ignored.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Newt responded by calling on Marianne to sit for a videotaped deposition and to account for all the couple's cash and stocks, suggesting that she had evaded their confidential financial agreement.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The agreement was subsequently released to the public.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>After a judge ruled that Bisek must testify, Newt volunteered that he would question her.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Bisek admitted their six-year affair, but refused to comply when Marianne's attorney subpoenaed various gifts, letters and documents.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Outstanding legal issues were never settled since after going to mandatory mediation, the Gingriches reached "full settlement" on Dec. 16.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Final signing of the settlement on April 3, 2000 asked that the judge seal the agreement so that its terms would remain secret.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>One aspect of the outcome was announced, however: Newt and Callista Bisek would be married August 18, 2000.</a>
