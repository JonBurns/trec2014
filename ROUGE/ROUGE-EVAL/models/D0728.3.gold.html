<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A genetic engineering drug, interferon, has been developed from protein isolated from human cells.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is proving effective in the treatment of liver diseases hepatitis C and hepatitis B, multiple sclerosis, and life-threatening tumors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is in the early stages of study in the treatment of cancer with some promising results.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Until recently, it was the only treatment for hepatitis but now there is a new treatment approach involving combinations of interferon and ribavirin.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is manufactured as Rebetron by Schering-Plough Corp. and is sold as a kit.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The interferon is sold as Intron A, the only type approved for use with ribavirin.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Other forms are increasingly available from different manufacturers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Interferon alone eliminates hepatitis C in about 10-20 percent of patients, about 50 percent do not respond, while the remaining 30-40 percent respond and then relapse.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In the combination theory, after relapse the patient is given the ribavirin.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Studies show that after six months all signs of the virus were gone in 82 percent of those on the combination compared with half on interferon alone.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Interferon can cause serious side effects such as fever, lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast infection, urinary tract infections, and depression.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The drug combination can cause breathing difficulty, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia, anemia, anorexia and occasionally birth defects.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Schering-Plough's treat kit costs about $1,831 for a six-week supply.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A six-month treatment costs $6,400 to $8,000.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Patients accuse Schering of "bundling" the products in order to compel them to use its interferon.</a>
