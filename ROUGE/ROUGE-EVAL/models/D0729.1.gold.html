<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Eric Robert Rudolph was charged with bombing an abortion clinic in Birmingham, AL on Jan. 29, 1998 and three earlier bombings in Atlanta, GA 1996-97.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Birmingham bombing killed one person and injured another.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta killed one and injured 111 while bombings at an Atlanta abortion clinic and a gay bar injured nine.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Pursuit of Rudolph began within hours of the Birmingham bombing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The operation involved the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local legal authorities.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The search scoured the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina where Rudolph lived as a boy.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The area is heavily forested mountainous terrain with peaks reaching to 5000 feet, heavy hardwood forests and thickets of virtually impenetrable rhododendron.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Hundreds of mines and caves dot the area.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It was thought that Rudolph, an accomplished sportsman and survivalist, was able to hide in inaccessible mines or caves while stealing food for sustenance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The search for Rudolph involved as many as 200 armed officers and employed bloodhounds and helicopters with infrared viewing capability.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The FBI placed Rudolph on its ten most wanted list and offered a reward of $1 million for information leading to his apprehension.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>After a year without success the search was scaled back and in March 2002 it was announced that the task force would dismantle its command post in June.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In August it was reported that the 31-month unsuccessful pursuit of Rudolph had cost $24.6 million.</a>
