<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Eric Rudolph, a 31-year old carpenter is wanted for bombing an Alabama abortion clinic on 29 January 1998 and three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An explosion July 27, 1996 at Centennial Olympic Park killed one woman and injured 111 people.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In a pair of explosions January 27, 1997, seven people were injured outside an Atlanta abortion clinic.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A bombing at a gay nightclub in Atlanta February 21, 1997 injured five people.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Rudolph became a suspect when witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the January 1998 bombing.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to him.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Six months later, Rudolph was identified by a food store owner near Nantahale Lake in Western North Carolina not far from where he first lived.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>He stole the man's truck and took about a six-month supply of food.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>About 200 FBI, state, and local officials began searching the remote densely forested area employing helicopters, dogs, and survival-training volunteers.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Evidence from the abandoned truck, buried trash, and boot prints proved he was in the area.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A one-million dollar reward for information, distribution of photos, and prime-time TV exposure were employed to no avail.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Rudolph has eluded police for three years.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>He is an experienced survivalist, knows the area well, has altered his identity by growing a beard and long hair, and is probably hiding in one of the area's hundreds of caves or mines.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The search effort has been reduced to relying on volunteer information.</a>
