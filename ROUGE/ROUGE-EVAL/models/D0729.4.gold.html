<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Eric Rudolph was charged in several bombings, including three in Atlanta, Georgia (Centennial Olympic Park, an abortion clinic in Atlanta, and a gay nightclub), and one at a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Rudolph was connected to the Alabama bombing but escaped a police dragnet and, loaded up with food and supplies, hid for five and a half months in the woods of western North Carolina.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He emerged only once to obtain a six-month supply of food and steal a pick-up - then disappeared into the woods again.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He was known to be an outdoorsman and survivalist and was hiding in familiar woods near his childhood home.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The man from whom Rudolph had obtained the food and truck had waited at least two days to report the stolen pickup, but was not suspected of aiding Rudolph.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He provided an updated description of him, thinner with beard and ponytail.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In searching for Rudolph the government conducted one of the most extensive manhunts in recent history.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The FBI put him on the 10-Most-Wanted list and offered a million dollar reward for information leading to his arrest.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As many as 200 agents at a time were searching the woods for him.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Investigators used trackers, helicopters, dogs, and sophisticated surveillance equipment.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In March 2000, the task force was to dismantle the command post because the trail had grown cold.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The publicly acknowledged cost of the 31-month search was 24.6 million dollars.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As of 18 August 2000 Rudolph had not been found.</a>
