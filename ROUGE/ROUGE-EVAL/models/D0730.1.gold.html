<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Congress passed a law authorizing the line item veto (LIV) in 1996 accepting arguments that the measure would help preserve the integrity of federal spending by allowing the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation thus encouraging the government to live within its means.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It was considered in line with the historic relationship between Congress and the president and would provide a tool for eliminating wasteful pork barrel spending while enlivening debate over the best use of funds.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It was argued that the LIV would represent presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>President Clinton exercised the LIV on 82 items in 1997 saving $1.9 billion in spending projected over five years.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The affected items were projects for specific localities, many in the area of military construction, which had been added to the president's budget by Congress.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The first court ruling on the LIV act was in U.S. District Court when in February 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the separation of powers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Department of Justice appealed that decision and in June 1998 the Supreme Court ruled the LIV act unconstitutional but on the grounds that it violated Article I, 7, Clause 2 (The "presentment clause") of the Constitution that establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>President Clinton expressed his deep disappointment.</a>
