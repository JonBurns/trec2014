<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In 1996 a Republican congress overwhelmingly passed a Line Item Veto Act allowing presidents (including the incumbent Democratic president), to strike individual tax or spending items within 5 days after signing a bill into law.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Congress could restore those items in a new bill passed by majority vote.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the president vetoed that bill, Congress could override that veto with a two-thirds majority.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Proponents argued that the law preserved the integrity of federal spending, saved billions of dollars, and that it did not repeal any portion of a law, but was simply a delegated spending authorization from Congress.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In January 1997, the first year of the law, the president vetoed 163 line-items in six bills, and in 1998 82 line-items in 11 bills.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In October 1997 Congress overrode the president's line-item veto against 36 of 38 military construction projects.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Initial 1997 efforts by congressmen to challenge the law in the Supreme Court were rejected due to lack of standing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On June 25, 1998 after lower courts rejected the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, on appeal by the White House the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Congress unconstitutionally violated the principle of separation of powers, because that procedure allows the president to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress in violation of the Constitution's Article I "presentment" clause.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A constitutional amendment would be required to institute line item vetoes.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Justices Breyer and Scalia argued similar dissenting opinions that separation of powers was not violated.</a>
