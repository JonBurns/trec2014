<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the words of President Clinton the line item veto "is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The line item veto has been sought by presidents since Grant and was popularized by Reagan.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It was part of Republican "Contract with America" led by Speaker Newt Gingrich that enacted it.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The line item veto allows the president to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Previously the president could only veto entire bills.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Bill Clinton is the only president to have had line item veto authority.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He has said that it should be used sparingly.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>He used it 163 times, mostly to delete items from the military construction bill.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The line item veto was challenged by a group of most Democratic senators but was dismissed by the Supreme Court.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, another challenge led by New York Mayor Giuliani and Idaho farmers resulted in a federal judge declaring the line item veto unconstitutional.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The Justice Department appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Supreme Court rejected the line item veto as a departure from the basic constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The Court found that the line item veto violates the "presentment clause" of Article I that establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The Court vote was 6-3 with Justice Stevens writing for the majority.</a>
