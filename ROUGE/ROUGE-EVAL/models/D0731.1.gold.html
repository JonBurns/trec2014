<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On Jan. 12, 1998 Linda Tripp, a 48-year-old Pentagon employee who had previously worked at the White House, contacted Clinton investigator Ken Starr's office to turn over tapes of telephone conversations between her and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern half her age.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These tapes became critical evidence in the impeachment trial of President Clinton.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By the time Tripp was called to testify before the grand jury in July 1998 she had recorded 40 conversations totaling 20 hours, 38 of her own volition and two in cooperation with the FBI.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The tapes contained Lewinsky's description of her intimate relations with President Clinton.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The public reacted negatively to Tripp's betrayal of the young woman who regarded her as a close friend and confidante, but Tripp was seen as one of the most important witnesses to appear before the grand jury in Ken Starr's five-month-old inquiry.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Questions about Tripp's motives arose when it was disclosed that she recorded the conversations on the advice of a New York book agent, Lucianne Goldberg, and had also contacted lawyers for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against Clinton telling them of his relationship with Lewinsky.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>After Clinton's acquittal in the impeachment trial Linda Tripp faced indictment in Maryland for secretly recording telephone conversations in defiance of Maryland law.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Charges were dropped for insufficient evidence after a judge ruled Lewinsky's testimony was tainted and inadmissible.</a>
