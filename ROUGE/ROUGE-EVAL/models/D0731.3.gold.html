<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Linda Tripp was an older woman with whom Monica Lewinsky became a close friend.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Lewinsky confided the most intimate details of an affair she was having with a married man.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>They often had as many as 20 phone calls or emails a day.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It was Tripp who recommended that Lewinsky hang on to the blue dress stained from an encounter with the president.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Tripp delivered over 20 hours of taped conversation she had with Lewinsky to the Ken Starr investigation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Tripp underwent three days of testimony before the grand jury.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>When she emerged from her final day of testimony, she tried to portray herself as a victim rather than a schemer.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Tripp had been granted immunity by Starr so her tapes could not be used in Maryland court.</a>
