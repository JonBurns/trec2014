<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Wolves were reintroduced into the wild in several areas of the country under the Endangered Species Act.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By June 1998, there were about 2500 gray wolves in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, a great success for the reintroduction program, as well as smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The wolves that had been reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho flourished, by May 1999 there were about 225 adults and 125 pups.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, wolves from different populations were mating and wolves were found in territories well outside Yellowstone.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In January 2000 a federal appeals court ruled that the wolves could remain in the northern Rockies, reversing a 1997 decision saying that their reintroduction was illegal.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The reintroduction of the Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies, to the Southwest was less successful.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In early 1998, the Interior Department released 11 wolves - of which five were killed, one was missing and presumed dead, and five were returned to captivity.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The killings remained unsolved.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The second year there were plans to release as many as 17 more wolves - with their radio collars and hind quarters spray painted orange or pink.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In July 1999 a pack of wolves that was attacking cattle in eastern Arizona had to be relocated.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>By July 2000 the Interior Department was ready to reduce the protection of almost all gray wolves from "endangered" to "threatened," signifying the great success of the reintroduction program.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Mexican gray wolves in Southwest would continue to be on the endangered list.</a>
