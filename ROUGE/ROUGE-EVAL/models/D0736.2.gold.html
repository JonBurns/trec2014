<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Oprah Winfrey has become the richest and most influential woman in entertainment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Her popularity stems primarily from her TV talk show that has won 32 daytime Emmy's in its focus on family relationships, health, fashion, beauty, and books.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Oprah started a book club to encourage inspirational reading and has invited writers such as Robert Morgan, author of "Gap Creek", and change-your-life guru, John Gray, to discuss their books.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>She also, for the first time, recently invited presidential candidate Al Gore, followed a week later by George Bush, both in an appeal for women's votes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Recently she has begun featuring a "change your life" theme on her show that focuses on who you are and a truth-will-set-you-free attitude.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Her show declined, however, briefly after her disappointing role in "Beloved".</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>She also faced a lawsuit because her show allegedly "melodramatized" the mad cow disease.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>She was cleared of giving false information and defaming cattle producers.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Oprah received high praises for teaching a class at Northwestern University on "Dynamics of Leadership".</a>
