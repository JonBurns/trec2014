<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Swiss balloonist Bertand Piccard was forced to abandon his first attempt to circumnavigate the world non-stop in a balloon six hours after take-off because of a fuel leak, January 12, 1997.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>His second attempt began January 28, 1998.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Well on his way, Piccard had to abandon this attempt when China refused him entry, causing him to miss out on needed winds.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After weeks of delays trying to get fly-over permission from China, Piccard and British balloonist Brian Jones took off from Chateau d'Oex in the Swiss Alps on March 1, 1999 for a third attempt.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>They drifted down to North Africa, crossed toward Asia and, with prior permission, passed over southern China.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A jet stream whisked them over the Pacific Ocean and then grinded to a near halt over Central America.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They picked up another jet stream, and on March 19, beat the endurance record set just two weeks before.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On the morning of March 21, after 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes aloft, balloonists Piccard and Jones landed on the Saharan sands of southern Egypt.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Unfavorable winds prevented their hoped-for landing near the Pyramids.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>They had crossed their 9 degrees longitude finish line the day before, setting a record for the first nonstop hot-air balloon circumnavigation of the globe.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For their feat, Anheuser-Busch Corporation awarded the balloonists a cup and $1 million prize money, some of which they will use to start the Winds of Hope Foundation charity.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The International Olympic Committee will award them the Olympic Order.</a>
