<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On March 21, 1999, after 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes aloft, the first persons to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon touched down in Egypt's Sahara Desert.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and British adventurer Brian Jones had traveled non-stop for 29,206 miles to complete their record-setting journey.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Piccard had made two previous attempts at the feat in 1997 and 1998 with two differing teams--the first was abandoned after only six hours aloft because of a hazardous fuel leak; the second attempt was aborted after the balloon was denied permission to fly through China's airspace.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On this third, successful voyage, the team launched from Switzerland and drifted southwestward to North Africa before catching a favorable jet stream at 9.27Â° west longitude.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>From there the team flew east across Asia, over the Pacific for six days to Mexico, then across the Atlantic to complete the final leg of their journey.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Piccard and Jones piloted their innovative, helium/hot-air hybrid balloon-- the Breitling Orbiter 3--by controlling the craft's rising and falling in order to catch the winds (typically jet streams) that seemed to be going in the most promising direction; satellite communication, navigation, and weather monitoring systems kept them in touch with their control centers, and provided guidance essential to success and survival.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Achieving what was hailed as the last great milestone of aviation, the two received awards from the International Olympic Committee and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, as well as a $1 million prize from Anheuser-Bush Co.</a>
