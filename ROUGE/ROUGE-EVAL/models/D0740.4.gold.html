<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland wanted to be the first to circumnavigate the world non-stop in a balloon.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He made three attempts, taking off from a mountain in the Swiss Alps near Lake Geneva with different crewmembers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On his first attempt the balloon landed in the Mediterranean some six hours after take-off because of a fuel leak.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On the second attempt he landed in Myanmar when China refused to allow entrance into Chinese air space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The third attempt started on March 1.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Piccard and British teammate Brian Jones gained valuable time by obtaining flight permission from China before taking off.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They spent six days crossing the Pacific, then flew over Belize and into the Caribbean.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The pilots were worried that they might not have enough fuel to reach the finish line, but found favorable winds to carry them across the Atlantic.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>They spent a final night flying across Africa before landing in the Sahara some 300 miles south of Cairo.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>They had spent almost three weeks in the balloon and had traveled almost 30,000 miles, then had to wait seven hours for an Egyptian helicopter to fetch them.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The International Olympic Committee was to award the Olympic Order to the two balloonists and the balloon was to be permanently housed at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The two men also received a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which was to be donated to charity.</a>
