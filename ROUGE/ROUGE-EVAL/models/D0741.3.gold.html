<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Forty-four-year-old day trader and chemist Mark Barton went on a shooting rampage at two Atlanta brokerage offices, killing nine people and wounding 13.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He eluded police for five hours after the shootings before killing himself as they closed in.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Police later discovered the bludgeoned bodies of his estranged wife and two children in her suburban Stockbridge apartment.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In a note left near his family's bodies, Barton vowed to kill "the people that greedily sought my destruction".</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>He wrote that he regretted killing his wife, and that he killed his children from a previous marriage, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them future pain.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>His wife was killed two days before the shooting rampage, his children the day before.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Investigators pieced together a picture of a distraught man who'd been a loner as a teenager, had paranoid tendencies and a quick temper, and was troubled by unexplained fears.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Barton had lost as much as $450,000 on gambling and Internet stock trading in the past year, including $153,000 in a 3-day binge, and $105,000 in the 15-day period before the killing started.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Also, Barton was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother, although he was never charged.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The tragedies prompted close public scrutiny of the day trading industry's policies for disclosing the risks.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Victims and their relatives have filed ten lawsuits in the year following the incident, naming as defendants the two brokerages, their landlords, their security firms and Barton's estate.</a>
