<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>At approximately 9:40pm Friday, July 17th 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr., the only surviving son of the 35th president, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette, were killed when a Piper Saratoga, piloted by John, crashed into 110-foot deep water about seven miles south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport, NJ at 8:38pm.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The plane was last seen on radar at 9:39pm.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at 2:15am Saturday.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The first search vessel was launched at about 4:30am.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An Air National Guard C-130 and many Civil Air Patrol aircraft joined the search.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The wreckage was not found until the following Wednesday, after the oceanographic survey ship "Rude" and the salvage and recovery vessel USS Grasp joined the search.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Navy divers found all three people strapped in their seats.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An at sea burial of all three was conducted Friday aboard the destroyer USS Brisco in view of the Jacquelin Kennedy Onassis shore-front estate.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in mid 2000 that pilot error was the probable cause.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It was very dark with a thick haze and Kennedy, a relatively-inexperienced pilot, was flying over water with no lights for reference - conditions conducive to "spatial disorientation" where pilots lose their sense of position and motion relative to the earth's surface.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Radar analysis indicated that the plane was falling at 5,000 feet per minute, possibly indicating a "graveyard spiral," a corkscrew descent where the pilot has lost control.</a>
