<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for crops and the use of antibiotics or hormones in livestock.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The organic food industry grew in the US in the 19990s at a 20 percent annual rate.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sales in 2000 were expected to reach $6 billion.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Estimates were that the industry would grow in the 2000s about 25 percent a year.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Organic food products, while mainly available in specialty stores, were becoming increasingly available in mainstream stores.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Once a political statement, organic foods became a health statement, especially by affluent baby-boomers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Critics maintained that food labeled organic was not necessarily safer or more nutritious than conventional foods.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Moreover, because federal standards were lacking, consumers could not be certain that food labeled organic was in fact organic; meat and poultry labeled organic could have been raised using growth hormones or antibiotics.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The US Department of Agriculture in 1997 proposed a national certification program for organic foods to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The program, however, would have allowed foods labeled organic to contain genetically modified ingredients and to be decontaminated using irradiation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It also permitted sewer sludge to be used as fertilizer.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>More than 275,000 comments were received in response to the proposed new rules, nearly all opposed to the processes the department considered allowing.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The department responded in 1999 by issuing improved regulations prohibiting these processes and in 2000 by issuing a rule offering a strict standard defining what constitutes an organic food.</a>
