<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side effects. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But the drugs can have serious side effects. </a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Tested in such a group, Rebetron reduced the virus to undetectable levels in 45 percent, an effect that persisted when the patients were tested again six months after treatment ended. </a>

<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Most patients treated with interferon eventually relapse. </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In some patients, drugs can make all signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect lasts. </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects. </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior. </a>
