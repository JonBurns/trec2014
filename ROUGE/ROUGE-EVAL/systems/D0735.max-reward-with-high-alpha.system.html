<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>WOLF KILLED-Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this case, though, the victim is a wolf. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We departed, one by one, newcomers arrived, one by one, and I am sure that as long as the wolves were visible, someone was there to watch them do their wolf act. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot, three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and presumed dead, and four remain. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>At that point, the wolves might be removed from the federal Endangered Species List. </a>
